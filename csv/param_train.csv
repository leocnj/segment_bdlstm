"01_segment-01","Okay this is according to when I was working at ATandT that um we had to come up with an application that was used for uh small group interactions like you would call someone and another","person and the third person. uh The application had a small like uh sort of guide to look up peoples name etcetera. uh The problems was that uh it was very forward looking so it was like a","group of people loosely brought together and there really wasn't a leader in that uh condition. And on my job was at the time I was doing human factors which is ease of use and I was also","doing some web design too so there was some design elements there as well. And uh what I decided at the early out set because I didn't want this to the one of those projects that happened","at ATandT a lot, which is to just to spiral into nowhere. Was I started to create prototypes very early on that were interactive. Rather than just give screenings and diagrams of what to do","I created an interactive prototype that people could use. And started to distribute that teams of developers, to the and artist etcetera. uh Even there was a marketing person on the team.","uh And so I did that because like I said I wanted to see, I thought it was a great project and I wanted to see it go at least close to close. And uh so by doing that a lot of people would","bounce all the ideas off of me, the developers would come to me with their designs afterwards to make sure they match with uh what I was designing. And for the most part I helped bring","that, I believe I helped bring that uh entire project to close and they did actually create a product and try it out. It was again this experimental product but they did do that, so um [it","was], I don't normally like to be a leader but again I just didn't feel like I was going to waste my time on a project which happened at ATandT a lot. So uh like I said had a good benefit",1,5.8
"01_segment-02","When I was working here uh in my fourth or fifth year we were bringing TOEFL, new TOEFL out to the market. And uh it had already launched but there was a huge amount of development we still had to do on it because","we need to get it out at a certain point. So this was sort of like a phase two part of the project uh and I was one of the business analysts. There were five lead business analysts and each business analyst had","four or five people assigned to them, uh systems analysts if you will. And uh at that time they also decide set up a multi program type of registration system. So all the other analysts were put on there and I was","a given all of TOEFL uh and all of the systems analysts. That was close to eighteen people uh reporting back to me. And there was also a lot of uh frustration amongst uh these systems analysts because they were","right at the forefront uh to get everything done in time so I would say morale wasn't exactly high. Uh So one of the things, the first thing of it of course was I had my own job to do, I still had to do the","business analyst part and I had to do it for all the missing business analysts. So the first thing I did of course was to delegate and I created a structure, so who reported to whom etcetera. That helps with the","whole work aspect, the amount of emails I got etcetera and timing we spent was cut down drastically. So that was sort of phase one of my solution, the second thing was of course to deal with the uh morale. And that","was a little trickier because there were people who were not getting along with each other, people who were etcetera, but I also had to go by their skills set. So uh I managed to put together four teams that were","working very well, probably only needed about maybe an hour's worth of my time every week. But then there were two other teams that I dealt with some conflicts. So all I had to do, what I had to do is sacrifice a","little bit of my own time and make sure I was in those team meetings and those group meetings a lot. And then provide reinforcement and also be a buffer whenever it was needed. And we got everything out in time so",1,5.7
"01_segment-03","uh In the example I was just giving, um in two of the teams I said there was some personality problems, I do recall specifically","two people in one team that could not get along at all because they both came at every problem from opposite sides and just","continued to argue back and forth, but they were both very good at what they were doing. uh And needed to be within that function","that they were working on because that's where their expertise was. So um in that case at first it was difficult because I was","getting inundated with private emails from both of them. So I had to take as I said before a more active involvement in meetings","with them and I had to deal with certain occasions, was just um to pull one aside at some point and say Look I've read what you","have, it's valid but we're going with the other. I would just say That's the way we're doing it, that makes decisions as if they","were momentously important. They weren't but they were just sticking points that they were getting stuck on so I just 'called the","shots' type of situation. [Instead of trying to], I did not at all  work to try to mediate [so I just said], and that worked","because they I guess would, respected my opinion. So when I called for one or the other they went along with it and things calmed",1,3.9
"01_segment-04","One of the things I'm most proud about uh starting here at ETS and then all the time I've been here, is the ability to have the trust of the uh business stake holders, SBU's we call them, uh in","TOEFL. It's a very high pressured uh program because we do provide a lot of the money that ETS makes, there's competition in the field etcetera. So the business unit itself is very often under","pressure. And when I came on board as the EBA for them, they were extremely dissatisfied at that time with uh the interactions with IT, [with their interactions with], I knew the process going","there. And um what I did was I approached it very simply as I have as sort of a usability expert, is the first thing you need to do is find out what's wrong. Have people run through things and","listen and look and watch and get all the information you could about where the major problems are, where in the user interface. So it's the same thing with uh interacting with people. And I went to","them I introduced myself, I asked them literally what problems are you having? And I assured them that I would fix them and I did. I mean that's, the easiest thing is to say uh What do you do in","those situations? Well you do what needs to be done to gain their trust. And if it's fast response times you do that. uh Always, I always made sure that every response back was completely truthful.","I never tried to hide anything because I think in the past they were being misled was something they didn't like as well. So if we were going to have a delay they knew about it and they knew why.","And before long I was hearing things like um Why isn't that happening? And I was taught to explain, well that's good enough, we trust you. So to this day they really do like working with me and I do","like working with that team very much. And I think that's part of the reason I feel like it's a major accomplishment, it makes me feel good about the work I do here. And um I think they're very",1,5.8
"01_segment-05","Being a business analyst you're forever trying to compromise, you have business needs and then you have development requirements needs as well. So the business wants certain work to","be done but then it has to fit into a development schedule. And uh sometimes what's seen as one side is very easy, either, well you can change the requirement or the other side as","well or we can just do X. Uh turns out to be very complicated. Uh the best thing to do in those situations when I have to work and try to come out with something that both sides are","happy with, of course is just take the problem, break it down first. So if the business comes and they say We have a need. I often might be hearing a solution to that need so I have","to figure out what is the actual root problem, what are they trying to solve? So I can at least boil it down to that. That gives me more options when I work with development, because","they can suggest different solutions and I can go back to again the business. Uh in some cases it's a matter of just talking for instance that this is why something is difficult or to","the development why this is more important. Because everything is important from sometimes if the business sends things over you have to explain why a specific item is more important.","And you really will find that you get by and very quickly from people when they understand what's at stake. Uh or if they understand what the difficulties that have to be surmounted.","Another thing we do is we make sure everything gets prioritized. Uh that really helps a lot when you have to come out with uh a mutual solution because someone could readily see how","important or unimportant certain factors are to the other side and then they can come in some meeting. It happens a lot and it's one of the things we have to do in our job uh more",1,5.7
"01_segment-06","Getting people to buy into a proposal I have um, it's difficult to narrow that down to one specific instance because it","happens often. I could say before I was in uh usability design where you have to propose solutions to sometimes external","clients, sometimes internal. I would say uh web design the same thing, you come back with your proposal. And business","analyst sometimes you have to um bring as I said before business needs to a group and propose uh priorities, uh schedule,","etcetera. But in all those times uh what always helps is uh I would present data. I present information, in a clean logical","orderly fashion. That usually is the best convincer, uh especially when it came to design work. uh You explain why the","design was the way it was, why the graphics were laid out the way they were and how you decided along the lines of the","steps people would take to get from A to B in a particular website or application. uh By doing that you're selling your","idea and if it's logical and consistent and makes good sense and in some cases is efficient in terms of costs etcetera, you","have a winning solution. So um  [it's happened], it's part and parcel of all the jobs I've ever done so again I can't",1,5.5
"01_segment-07","Uh There have been many times when I've had to work with people that I didn't quite get along with. Uh Sometimes it was because of the personality of","the individual and sometimes I realize it was just because of a mix of personalities between myself and the individual. [Like I would] and those are","the easy ones that I would realize, it's okay just because I don't get along with that person? Because they have certain character traits that's the","opposite of mine I could just dismiss them more readily. But there are people I've worked with which have been exceptionally difficult to deal with.","And uh as I've learned over the years is the best thing to do is sigh privately uh and just keep your eyes on the goal of what you're trying to do on","the project. If they're difficult to deal with, if they're always uh glued for instance we can let them be. With you doesn't make a difference as long","as you get a good job done no one is really going to care in the end. And uh very often all the projects we work on are a short term. I think if it","was something where for instance someone had to work with consistently, the manager or something like that. [I would have to], you have ways to","escalate etcetera. But for the most part uh you just get through it and you stay professional. I mean that's the best way to do it, is keep everything","and allow it to a professional level. And uh let all the irritation out when you get home, uh ride the bike or something like that, that's all I could",1,4.3
"01_segment-08","I got some unpleasant tasks, uh no likes when you have a lot of the, tedious boring ones but you can get to those. I think the ones that people have to watch out","for are the ones that are physically demanding uh I know that one of my, when I was very young one of my bosses put me in a uh really terrible situation where uh","he had me working full time. Going to an after hours program at City University of New York which was a good hour and ten minute drive. And uh then put me on a","secondary project that was additional work to my own. So I was literally getting about three or four hours of sleep at night, every night for an entire year. And","uh I did complain, I did explain to him that I think my work was suffering and what eventually happened is actually ended up with a heart arrhythmia from the","stress. Uh And so I had to just literally sit down and tell him that on doctor's notice that if he didn't change one of my priorities immediately I would get ill","and he'd be responsible. So uh that's the only time I think people really need to pay attention to uh what the job is demanding, if stress levels are","inordinately high. Otherwise if they're things like as mentioned uh tedious or boring you'd find ways to distract yourself if you could do it, that's not so bad.","But physically demanding or extremely stressful, especially physically demanding, that's what you have to watch out for. Uh And be vocal about it, that what I","did learn, I should have spoken up much earlier. But I have learned that since, if things are too physically stressful I make that very clear to whomever my",1,4.7
"01_segment-09","Uh There have been times when I've had been on projects where one or two people have directed the, set","the direction of the project. And there are people who could have contributed more but may have been a","little bit more withdrawn. And uh the best thing to do in those situations is to make sure that everyone","has an opportunity to contribute and if you feel like the project is not going that way uh you could","always call me in specific topic and make sure that the people who could contribute better have an","opportunity to do something. So you've got to go to them personally first and say Look I want to set up","this meeting for whatever topic which they've been trying to get sort of a push in. And then uh get that","more visible, make sure everyone has the visibility to it. Uh I think as people, again maybe ignore","their contribution the idea is it's been made, it's been documented and uh so somebody decides to make a","different decisions based on what they feel instead of what they've seen that's always just going to be",1,4.8
"01_segment-10","Okay now earlier I had talked about when I first came on as a business analyst in TOEFL, um lead business analysts. uh Part of the problem they had was communication with the","IT groups and so one of the things I did as I said is I went I sat down with all the members team individually. And to get to more a detailed level uh what I really did in","the listening part of it was I actually listened for I think I call them catch phrases or phrases that were repeated over and over from person to person, that was my first","clue where there was a problem. So if somebody said, uh mentioned the phrase uh um weight on cost estimates came up a number of times. I'd want to backtrack and find out why","those costs estimates were late and what was it. Was it just personally somebody just sat on them or was it because we didn't have a good process, whatever it was. But the","idea was I use what I call catch phrases so something you hear, a phrase or a statement that's very similar from person to person that helps you map to a common problem in","communication. Because uh although everybody is different I think what irritates each person in specific circumstance if there's a general agreement you know that the","problems on the far end, not on the people who you're trying to deal with, it's on our end for instance IT. So because they all have like, if they all have that common","complaint. And uh by doing that as I've mentioned before really solved  a lot of the problems and a lot of them had to do with uh um lateness of response to  requests, and","part of that of course is knowing what are the important requests and what aren't important. So that's what I had done and that's what I sort of continue to do, just keep the",1,5.5
"01_segment-11","I don't know if it's culture of growing up in New York or not but I have never had","difficulty in expressing my opinion. Uh And that includes sometimes having to give","critical or difficult information, critical feedback or difficult information. And it","doesn't whether it's to a supervisor or an individual. Of course I'm not blunt about","it, I try to couch things in terms of you know it might be a good idea to do, or I","think there's a problem with to start off but to actually get to what the problem is uh","I just say it because if you do not like the way I've been brought up if you don't say","what the problem is you're never going to fix it. And uh I've had to do that with uh","supervision that's been difficult and supervision's been accommodating and all","different types of people. And I actually I think I have a reputation for just speaking",1,4.8
"01_segment-12","um There have been a number of times where I had had to take something that I've gotten say from the IT side uh as an explanation of why we could uh do something but it was going to be very complex, although it seems simple. Or why we couldn't","accomplish something without a lot more time, money etcetera. And present that to the business and um in all fairness it isn't that the business wouldn't understand some of the complexity but my goal was not to get into technical detail but to","get more into the reasons on what we should do. So very often what I do is I take a look at the whole thing, I get all the information I can first. Which is all the technical information, all the complexities, I work it out and say if I have to","create a PowerPoint slides, etcetera. I work out what is at the high level for each of the box of things I need to go over. What at the high level is the message that's being given so it's not as important to know what the specific field lens","are. Going from legacy to the new system etcetera and why System A can directly communicate with System B etcetera. [That isn't], the important thing is to simply say A cannot communicate with B. And I mean that's just the central message, or","that um uh if information is going to go from one system to another, we've got to completely change what the layouts and formats are because the informations are different. Again it's always what the reasons or what the effects are and what the","reasons are but not trying to get mired into details because that's what happens sometimes. People go down to such a detailed level and you lose your audience um uh because people are to busy trying to find out and understand those details when","that may not be the important thing. Of course if the technical detail is important, it's critical. You can go and spend time in that one detail but assuming here that were talking about trying to get to the understanding of a system or","complexity, so that's how I've done it. By the way um um the one about the communicating, to be honest the real answer should have been, you mustn't say Fix the communications. Whose ever on the phone and typing could you mute your side, that's","the most common uh .      I've been guilty of that myself.      I know I've forgotten sometimes it's not on mute. Isn't this the same thing?      um Let's see.      Because question one is.      Okay if it went back to the beginning of the",1,4.8
"02_segment-01","um I don't have a specific response to this question but um I do","believe that I am constantly striving to be um in a leadership role","when I'm doing my work. um I uh have never been the formal leader","uh in any of my positions. I've always been in a support role, but","um the tasks that I am provided with I do, I'm a self starter and I","do try to take on as much responsibility as I can in order to","accomplish them um with precision and perfection. um I'm trying to","think of something specific to give you. But uh I, it's really just","kind of a constant thing with me that I'm, in whatever task I'm","given I try to take on the role of responsibility and get it done",2,4
"02_segment-02","um [I guess this would be], it's, it actually isn't really work related but [it's], [I], [we] in the role","that I have we are sort of the um social planners for the division and um it sometimes falls to me, to","arrange the social gatherings for the group. That's in terms of when we're celebrating birthdays or that kind","of thing. And um it does take a bit of a rallying to get the group that I work with to concentrate on","something um that's a little bit less um test oriented uh shall we say. So um I do tend to have to kind of","rally through to get um these things planned and get them off the ground. And um we did just have our uh","summer picnic and um we managed to get the group out and get um everything planned, um from the sign up sheet","and the donations and everything to actually getting a location to have this and um enjoying it when we","finally planned it. So um [I don't], uh [I'm sort of] [in the job that I currently have I'm in a sort of],","it's a solitary role but every once in a while there is an opportunity to get the group together and to",2,4.1
"02_segment-03","I uh try to be the peace keeper uh [when I am], well basically all the time when I'm at work","or otherwise. Uh So uh the again the situation was when we were attempting to plan something","for the group. Um and uh we had several different ideas about how the, the uh event should go.","Uh and some people wanted to make it very extravagant and others wanted it to be very simple.","Uh So I basically just tried to get a compromise uh to come about. Uh It was not all that","successful but uh we did actually manage to get the uh event taken care of. But uh [the],","really I think the only way to deal with that kind of uh disagreement when you're working","together is to try to get some type of movement on either side as far as uh a compromise is","concerned because it's really not possible to let either party have his or her own way. So uh","that's usually my go to response, is to try to come up with a compromise and uh between two",2,4.7
"02_segment-04","I believe this is uh sort of a constant thing when ah one is working, um I recently had uh a change in supervisors and","um I think that is really uh a time, a recent time when I felt that I was trying to get to know a person that I was","working with, it was actually for my boss. And also um try to um maintain the uh way that my role had been setup within","the group. um Sometimes when new management comes on board they uh, that individual has different ideas about what they","want their team to be doing. And I was hired for a specific role and so um I was spending uh quite a bit of energy","trying to make sure that my new manager and I got off on the right foot that I was also um working to make sure that I","remained happy um in the position that I had been hired for. So um I, at this point I think we have, of course we are","working together well and I think it's been a successful transition. um In most things I believe I was successful in my","negotiation but there have been a few items added to my role that were not initially supposed to have been there but um","again we came to a compromise and uh I think it seems to have been a successful um relationship. Continues to be a",2,3.7
"02_segment-05","This answer sort of piggy backs off of the one that I just gave, uh again going back to my","new management situation. Uh Again the role that I was hired, the job that I was hired to do","did not necessarily fit the title that I was given. And so uh when my supervisor who came","from a different department arrived there was some minor disagreement about how to proceed uh","with my role within the group. So uh I feeling very strongly about what I had been hired to","do uh I had to negotiate and bargain and ultimately compromise. Uh But I did quite well. I","mean I've taken on some additional uh tasks that were not initially part of the role I was","hired for, uh they do, they  obviously add to my skill set and uh we have, you know we like","to continue learning and professional development is a good thing. Uh And they are not, they","don't detract from what I, what I enjoy doing and what I was hired to do. So it worked out",2,4.9
"02_segment-06","In my current role it seems that um whenever I propose an idea uh we have a discussion about it and then I hear about it for a","while and then suddenly the idea is in place and we are following the new rule that I suggested uh three weeks prior and no","credit is given to me. um So I basically put everything in an email so that um when I do come up with these ideas about uh","process improvements or what have you uh I have them documented so that when the powers that be um eventually decide that yes","it is a valid point and it is a good idea um I have the proof that it was something that I suggested and I can then put it in","my um results for the year. um But yes it's an unfortunate situation and the, in, on the project that I work on um this","happens a couple of times and uh it's fine. I know that I have uh documented that I'm the one that came up with the idea so um","I just hold on to them until it's appropriate to add them to my uh performance appraisal for the year. I guess I should","mention the the specific uh examples. So um we had for one thing um copyright permissions that our partners were managing, but","we have a database at ETS where their information was only partially included and I wanted the permissions uploaded and",2,3.9
"02_segment-07","Thankfully this doesn't happen all that often, um I don't know whether that's because I'm easy to get along with or um I","just really have nice people in my group. Um but there is one individual that uh does give me a little bit of difficulty uh","when I'm working with her. Uh [it's really], and it's not even that traumatic. [It's basically just a] uh, she has this","tendency of uh telling me how to do my portion of the job uh when it would be really great if she concentrated on getting","her portion of the job done. Um and uh I think, I mean it's just, it's a personality thing. I think it's just she just, you","know it's the mom in her or something. Uh but it really drives me crazy. Uh so uh I have different reactions to this. I","usually just try to ignore her comments. Uh but sometimes it becomes necessary for me to comment and I'm constantly, it's a","constant effort to just try to remain calm and collected, um and I really just, I just smile and nod. And sometimes I will","take her suggestions just to kind of move the day along. Uh and sometimes I kind of just pretend that I'm taking her","suggestions. But really [it's], we're outwardly friends, it's not a huge deal. We don't, it doesn't preclude us from being",2,4.3
"02_segment-08","This must be why I want to come and work at your company, because I never have found that unpleasant tasks get","shared among employees. um Usually in the roles that I've had I am constantly fighting, uh not to have all of the","unpleasant tasks dumped into my realm. And this is part of going back to the situation with my change in","supervision and the role that I was hired to do, it's a constant fight to not be sort of pushed back into that,","you know, Copy these ten thousand pages and put these five hundred binders together. um It's not the role that I","was hired for and um so I, although I am constantly trying to help out the group and volunteer and do more than","my fair share. um I also understand that if I want to progress and to get where I want to go I need to be able to","take on more interesting and more complicated, um more demanding tasks. So being stuck in a copy room uh eight","hours a day is not going to get me where I need to go. So um I am, it's a constant bargaining and compromise and","negotiation uh to make sure that um I don't get burdened with all of the um stuff that um doesn't take any brain",2,3.3
"02_segment-09","The first event that comes to mind uh in response to this question is actually not at work but at school. um I had","a professor actually the first professor that I uh had class with upon returning to school to finish my bachelors","and this particular individual was very uh opinionated. And rather than enjoying and um encouraging the expression","of her students it was very much that, it was obvious that it was a sort of my way or the highway type of","arrangement. And uh made uh grading essays and papers uh for this individual rather interesting. um I actually,","when I was taking the class I actually thought that I was not going to fair very well because I'm a rather stubborn","individual. And um in this particular situation I really wasn't interested in just feeding her back what she had uh","feed me. So um I did go ahead and write papers that I wanted to write and actually surprisingly it worked out. um","She had some rather unkind things to say when I submitted my thesis statement and my uh first couple of pages of","draft for my final paper. But when I gave her the finished product uh it obviously worked out because I did very",2,3.3
"02_segment-10","I'm using my listening skills constantly uh in my uh role. um I don't really have a","specific situation for this because I really think that listening is a hugely important","part of the entire communication process. um I can think of one colleague that um is one of","those individuals that um tries to talk constantly during any kind of discussion of","procedure or project or what have you. And um  not only that they talk very loudly. And um","so basically I just let this individual do most of the talking in that situation. um I find","that sometimes when um people are very vocal I will not say too much when we are in person","but then I may recap an email afterwards just to make sure that we are all on the same page","and that way it sort of levels the communication playing fields if you will. And we can","recount what was actually discussed in this meeting by an email where nobody is trying to",2,5.5
"02_segment-11","Well thankfully I haven't had to say anything to my supervisor about anything that I've done incorrectly. um I uh generally what","I'll do is I will, I send an email, and usually what I'm doing is I'm forwarding an email because I will have been in communication","with uh someone else on the project that I'm working on and um I will need to let my supervisor know either what's being asked of me","or if something has gone awry in the piece of the project that we're working on. um I need to let my supervisor know because it's","going to take more of my time. uh So generally email first and then take a walk over to uh her office so that she can absorb the","email and then when I show up she's going to know what's going on and we can talk about what if anything uh I need to do or needs to","happen that I hadn't already thought of. um [I guess] I mean the only feedback that I guess I might have been uncomfortable with was","when my professor had asked me to evaluate, my supervisor had asked me to evaluate some of my colleagues as part of their","performance appraisal.

I presented the information as um neutrally as possible",2,5.1
"02_segment-12","[There aren't], I don't deal with too too much complex or too too many complex or technical ideas uh in my current","role but um I can think of a couple of uh instances where I had to train some colleagues uh to cover some of my","tasks on a project as I was going out for vacation.

I am a, um I learn by","doing so I generally try to take that attack with people that I am trying to teach how to do something and I will","have them walk through the process or the procedure that I am trying to teach them so that they have the actual,","it's like that hand-eye coordination thing where if they're actually doing it I feel that it sort of registers with","them a little bit more than if we're just talking about the concept rather than following through with actually","doing it. um I try to be, I have uh quite a bit of patience so um I try to give individuals time to learn new","things. We'll talk about it once and then have another session a couple of days later to see if there are any","further questions and to see to make sure that they remember what we talked about and that they're comfortable with",2,5.9

So I was working uh with a group of teachers who were all doing the","same writing in class and we normally had uh one leader who would be there to help us out and make a lot of the plans. But that","teacher uh was out sick so we were doing our planning uh without him. Um so since it was a fairly large group it uh became clear","that we needed somebody to act like a leader. So uh we had a list of things that we needed to do, so some materials we had to","prepare, uh some schedules we needed to make and some things that we were going to have to turn in uh at a certain point. And I","just uh tried to come up with a schedule for things that we could uh do, a way to divide up some of the tasks. So uh I knew","people had done some of the things before so I got them to uh repeat that, to do what they had already done the last time that","we talked together. Um and, yeah basically I just, I feel like started the scheduling and uh didn't have to do too much to, to","be in that kind of leadership role, but it kind of got everything going because we were a little bit taken aback that the person","who was supposed to be doing that wasn't there. And then in the end we got everything done that we needed to do so uh it worked",3,5.8
"03_segment-02","So uh I'll talk about a time when my coworkers and I were working on rating some essays at the end of a semester. So in the program where we","worked all the teachers got together at the end of the semester to evaluate the essays that students wrote. And it's a pretty big uh","undertaking to get all of the essays for all of the students uh in that program all rated on the same day. um Double rated so two teachers um","giving a score for each essay. uh The background was uh a little bit more about the background for this particular time is that there was some","other event on campus and a lot of the instructors who would normally be there ended up not coming or leaving early, so we had a lot more work","to do than we normally would have. um So people were getting pretty frustrated with it and thinking that we were going to, going to be there","like all evening to finish up this work. So um what I tried to do to motivate people uh was to get an estimate of how much we needed to do, how","much we um already done, try to figure out how much time it was taking us to do it and then when we had a clear idea of the amount of work that","needed to be don I think people calmed down and uh were less upset about how much stuff we were going to have to do. And then uh motivated to","work quickly because when you had a real estimate of when you were going to be done uh it helped, it really helped to pace yourself. So it",3,4.6
"03_segment-03","Uh I'll talk about a time when I was working in a group of instructors. Uh We were teaching the same classes for the same two months period and we would","regularly have to get together for some meetings uh to work on uh  like reports for our director and some planning for our classes uh since we were","teaching the same classes and it had to do with getting students matriculated to the university. We needed to stay calibrated and uh grade our assignments","to stay and do the same amount of work so we had to meet together a lot. Um And there were two teachers who just had, batted heads pretty regularly because","they had different ideas about how to do things the best way. Um so uh I knew that both of them really wanted the same thing, they wanted to do well at","what we had to do. [So I tried to] uh, when I was in charge of making a decision, all of that would have something to do with the two of them. I would try","to like play to their strength, so one that was really good at organizing and schedules I tried to get her to take the lead on that so that she would feel","uh comfortable doing that job. And then the uh other woman was particularly creative so when we had something that had some flexibility and uh room for","creativity, I would uh try to encourage her too to take over that so that each of them could do something that they were good at and not be together trying","to decide uh the same thing because they would argue about it if they were both involved in the decision making if it was just those two. Uh It seemed okay",3,4.9
"03_segment-04","um I was working at a program where we got a new assistant director and she kind of came into a little bit of a hostile environment because people had expected an","internal candidate to be hired for the position that she got and she came from outside of our program to be in charge. um And it was also at a time in the program","where uh we had some pretty big changes to our students were a little bit uh, different of a population than our program was used to dealing with. Our program","grew quite a bit so we had more students than we uh were used to having. So we were having to come up with some new ways to deal with things like especially uh","registration, getting all the students signed up to classes, giving schedules to everybody, making sure that all of the international students knew how to get to","the different classroom buildings and stuff like that. So there was a lot of negotiation because everybody had their own idea of what worked before, what didn't","work and how we should change it. And then there was the fact that she was new. um A lot of the other uh teachers and some of the administrators had some kind of","not great feeling about her. They weren't sure about her. So I felt like I needed to get her to trust me and I was also one of the newer uh teachers. um So I","tried to talk to her about how we were both new and maybe didn't know the area as well, how we had this thing in common, uh so like having some small talk in","between our meetings or uh during meal times or something just to try to see what we had in common so that maybe she'd start to trust me and then I could get my",3,5.3
"03_segment-05","Um I was working at a program teaching and there was an instructor who had been at that program for a very long time. So I think more than twenty years, he","had been in charge for a really long time and all of a sudden there were a bunch of new teachers doing the same thing, uh the same class that he was where","he normally would have been teaching that class. Just on his own he would have been the only instructor, there'd been one section one of the class. Um So","since there was all of a sudden some more uh sections there were new instructors. Um But since he had been doing it for so long had a really rigid uh set of","uh assignments, uh with a set of schedules and uh rubrics a really specific way that he wanted everything done. But it didn't really work with all the","instructors teaching styles and we didn't think that it was the only way to have uh to get across what needed to be taught and to get the learning goals","accomplished. So uh we decided to talk with him about uh what in his plan absolutely had to be done and uh where there were places uh for us to do some","things that were interested in or to change things up and try something new. Um So uh we met at the part of the normal planning process with him. Uh We","outlined some things that we agreed we thought should be done and we brought up some things that we would like to try. Um And he didn't want to try them but","he agreed with us that it was worth a shot. And then he asked how it went, Um I still didn't think he would change his mind but it didn't seem like he",3,5.3
"03_segment-06","uh Once when I was teaching we had uh the time in their curriculum when they were deciding whether or not to continue using uh the","textbook or to get a new one. um And they sent a few of us to a conference where there was a textbook fair. We had the opportunity","to look at a bunch of different ones and then um they asked us to make recommendations. So um what I did ahead of time was to make","a list of problems that had come up with the textbook that was being used. So some issues that teachers had had or that students","had had using that textbook. um And then with the new one that we found at the um book fair, um I made a list of uh what I thought","in that new book um would be better um than the old one and how it would address some of the issues um that had come up with the","old book.um In the end they continued using the old one anyway, I think they had a deal with the publisher that they would be","exclusive and only use that line of textbooks. So um they didn't switch over to the new one. But because we had a few copies of the","new book and we had pointed out some good things that the new book had that the old book didn't have, I think a lot of um material","out of that book ended up getting used. So it ended up being useful even though the proposal to totally change textbooks didn't get",3,5
"03_segment-07","I had a supervisor uh that I didn't especially get along with uh for a while. So he was in charge of a group of teachers who were all teaching","the same course and he seemed to have a particular uh bias against newer teachers that since he was so experienced. Um He seemed to have a hard","time accepting uh a lot of the newer teachers. I think he was unhappy with how fast the program had grown and how quickly they had to hire new","teachers and he seemed to think that some of us because we were newer uh weren't experienced enough to be doing the same job as him since he","had so many more years of experience. Um So behaviors that I carried out in response to the situation, um I tried to uh limit any kind of","discussion of uh personal issues. Things about being young or being new or having less experience like not uh trying to exasperate, you know","that problem. I also, you know, like I realized he did have a lot of the experience and a lot of good advice so I would ask him, you know what","would you do? I have this situation or I have this challenge, and do you have some advice for me? And he ended up being happy to share advice.","And I mean of course he thought he knew a lot better than I knew uh what to do, so he was happy to tell me what to do. Um The outcome was, you","know, we were able to work together. You know, we didn't become best friends or anything but we did what we had to do and it was not super",3,5.7
"03_segment-08","One of the places where I worked would divide up some unpleasant tasks pretty evenly uh to begin with so things like um we served coffee to our students once a week in the uh library","and it was our responsibilities since we were guests to the library to clean up. So like vacuum, uh wash down the tables um after that. So it would initially be split up evenly among","everybody but there would always be people who had been there a long time who didn't show up or all of a sudden they were unavailable when it was their turn. And as one of the newer","employees I was asked to do it, to like step in more often than other people. um And I tried to look at it as an opportunity to work with some people that I didn't normally work","with. So a lot of times one of the assistance directors would also be doing that. So since you know we were kind of vacuuming together, taking out the trash together, it was a little","bit of a bonding experience. So I tried to turn it into something positive of getting to know her better. um And I think that that worked for me. Another unpleasant task was","substituting for teachers, they didn't pay people to substitute. They would just call you up and say Oh my Gosh, so and so is sick. Can you please come step in and do his class.","Because I lived really close by I got called a lot more than anybody else. So it, you know I think it was more than my fair share of that. um I understood why they were doing it. I","initially always was accepting it because I wanted to make a good impression. But um after I had been there a little bit longer I would say, because sometimes I had something else to","do. I couldn't just drop everything and run to uh substitute, teach a class. I would just say, you know, I'm sorry I'm not available or even maybe not pick up the phone. um But I",3,5.1
"03_segment-09","I was in a uh group of people planning a reading and writing class.um We had a woman who was in charge of the groups since she had been there the","longest. And we were trying to decide which novel to read uh for our class. um And she basically ignored everybody else's suggestion of what um","people thought would be good books to use for the class and went with her own uh suggestion of a book she had taught before. um I knew that book","and I knew it was a good book so I wasn't opposed to that uh book. And when I was teaching that reading and writing class I just tried to put my","own spin on it. I had assignments that were a little bit different that hers. Even though we were teaching the same class we didn't have to do all","the same assignments. So I tried to make it my own a little bit. um We shared how our classes were going and people would try out different things","that other teachers were doing. So um there was some uh sharing even though the initial uh contribution had been ignored. um So the outcome was I","think everybody had a good class and then the next time that the next group of people were getting together uh she was a little bit more open and","uh somebody else's suggestion that she hadn't taken um the session before. uh She decided to make a change and go with something new um and that","one was also fine. We also you know, did the same thing of everybody kind of took it their own. We didn't do exactly the same thing as each other.",3,4.3
"03_segment-10","ah The communication problem that I'll talk about was related to retention meetings that we used to have at the end of our uh sessions. So the teachers would all get","together um to discuss grades, final exams, scores, and whether or not a student would pass on to the next level or be retained and have to repeat a level in our in","our language program. um The communication problem was that there was sometimes um maybe poor uh record keeping or poor planning in organizing how to get all of the","uh information that was used to make those uh retention decisions. So um every now and then a mistake would be made, you know like um somebody who could have passed","would be retained, or somebody who should have been retained didn't get retained um because uh it seems like the people who were putting it in the system didn't","communicate well with each other. So um [what I would do], and also because the meetings weren't run particularly well, it was kind of a free for all, everybody uh","shouting their um information because they all want, just want to leave the meeting as soon as they could. So um what I tried to do was I had my list of students","that I needed to talk about that were in danger of being retained. I had strong feelings on whether or not they should be retained and I made sure to take notes. uh","When the other instructors who heard those students were talking about them. So I would listen to what they were saying, um take notes and see if we agreed or not.","And um when it came down to the end of the meeting I would just make sure that the decision that got recorded went along with the notes that I had taken during the",3,5
"03_segment-11","So I was asked to train a new team member um and was asked to give feedback about how the training was going and it turned out to be uh difficult because","it was critical feedback, because the person was having a really difficult time. Uh It just seemed like it wasn't a good fit for the work that needed to","be done. Uh He didn't follow instructions all the time and sometimes he would just ignore what people had asked him to do. He would make up uh his own","instructions. If something didn't go right he didn't ask for help, he would just either not do the assignment or do the assignment totally wrong uh","because something at the very beginning of the assignment didn't go right. Um So uhbehaviors, I carried out in response to the situation. I was um asked","very specific questions about his performance, so um some emails with specific questions about what he had done and how it was going. um A couple of","meetings where uh other people who were involved in training this uh person were asked for their opinions about it. Um So I just answered honestly about","what I knew about just the facts of how everything was going on um without talking about the emotional aspect of being frustrating to try to train","somebody um that didn't seem like they were listening. You know, just kind of saying, this is the assignment we asked to do, this is what didn't go","correctly, this is the instruction that wasn't followed. Uh This is what I said to ask to get the assignment redone, explaining um where the mistake was",3,5.3
"03_segment-12","I was uh teaching some language classes and our uh like our computer person uh for the program gave a presentation about a new um website that teachers could use, kind of like a","social networking website but for um uh classes so the teacher has the site and the students can go on and um do assignments and interact with each other. Um and the uh","presentation that we went to was pretty high level so some of the fancier things that that uh program was capable of doing. Um but I was teaching with a small group of um","experienced teachers but who were a little afraid of computers. So they were a little bit overwhelmed by that presentation we had gone to about, all the fancy things that you","could do on that website. But I had actually used it before, um had done some of the fancy things that were in the presentation, but there's a lot more, a lot more um","capabilities that um were pretty simple, so what I did was just uh show them the site that I had made for my class before. Showed them all the simple things that uh it could do,","things that made it really easy for them, like just things like even taking attendance which is not difficult to do at all in that website but something that hadn't been in the","presentation. So um they were thinking they wouldn't use it at all because they didn't want to do all the, you know fancy games um that had demonstrated um or they weren't going","to do the kind of assignments that had been uh shown in the presentation. But when they saw some things that were pretty useful to them, um like putting up your homework","assignments on there so that you don't have 20 students emailing you after class saying what's the homework. You know they saw the benefit of that so I think they uh got over",3,5.4
"04_segment-01","We had a discussion at one of our staff meetings about problems that we were having with the folks in our procurement area because we weren't in sync with how","we were handing over our work to them and how they were getting work back to us. So a group of us uh decided to become a team to work on this project and we","called it the contract pill process. Uh we had a meeting and we started talking about what the difference pieces were and I said you know I think we really","need a grid of some kind so that we can look at all of the different parts of this project and make sure that we don't leave anything out. So I sort of mapped","out for the group what I thought the grid would look like and over the next actually almost two years we played around with this grid. We had discussions with","uh people internally and uh I did a lot of proof reading. Every time we changed the grid there were problems with it and we had to keep adjusting uh the","English and the punctuation and grammar and things like that. Uh and we also periodically met with some of the stakeholders to go over what we were doing, uh","and I was trying to take a leadership role in that to make sure that we talked to all of the right people and got all the information down that we needed in","order to get some agreement so that we could move forward. So as I said, it took about two years. I was not the formal leader of this group, uh but I did have","a lot to do with making it I think go forward and was trying to make sure that all the people who needed to be involved were included in the decision making.",4,6.1
"04_segment-02","um A number of years ago when I worked at Prudential I was responsible for the policy issuing and our underwriting department. And um I had a group of very low level clerical folks who were pretty much unappreciated","in the department because the appreciation was really toward the underwriters who made the decisions on which people could get insurance and which people couldn't. And the policy issue people were those who did all","the paperwork at the end to make sure that the individual agents got the right policies for their customers and that we were able to make the sale. um So what happened was all the work from the underwriters would","get dumped on the policy issue people, [and they had], it wasn't exactly service little agreements, but there were um some objectives for how much time things were supposed to take and how much fast we were supposed","to get the work out of the, um out of the office. So um the policy issue people knew very specific things that they had to do to prepare to these policies. This was long before we had any computerized system doing","this so they were actually um standing in front of large um bins and picking actual pages to put in the policy and then inserting them into the policy, and the last step in that was to do something called grommeting","where we put the policy through a machine to um fix a little metal piece to it so that if a policy holder ripped the policy apart, um it would be pretty evident that it happened, and this way the pages shouldn't get","lost. um Anyway, because I was not um well versed or trained in how to do the policy issue work, my job um that I picked uh for when we were working overtime, holidays, Saturdays, things like that, was to run around","and grab all of the policies as the policy issue people finished them, run to the grommet machine, get them grommeted, put the policies in the right place. And there was a little counter in the machine so I would","call out, Okay we've done a hundred policies this morning or We've done a hundred and twenty. And I would try to keep up the motivation by telling people how much work we had finished in the period of time that we",4,4.7
"04_segment-03","I mentioned earlier about the contract pill process that we worked on in uh my area here at ETS and when we were doing that project we had several people from our uh contract area and several people from","procurement. Uh And I think that really uh the, the contract people had much more investment in this because we were the ones who had to make sure that everything got to the right place when it was all done.","Uh the procurement people have a much lesser role of, they obviously put together the purchase order, that's very important to uh the external supplier. Uh But the amount of time and effort that it takes to","put the purchase order together is usually much less than the contract manager job. So when we were meeting with the people from procurement they uh didn't really seem to think that this was all that","important, they didn't kind of get why we were having these meetings. Uh And I guess I spent a fair amount of time trying to talk with them about the work that they do, uh ask them how they do the work, how","they should, how they felt they could interface with us and what they thought the good outcome would be uh so that we could all come to a conclusion that would work for both groups. Uh And so uh we tried to","do that in a number of meetings, uh sometimes we had meetings just with the contract managers to come up with strategy for how to work with the procurement people in this process. Uh But in the end I think uh","that the three of us on the contract side worked well together in coming up with ideas for how we could uh work better with the other group. And then to convince the other group about all the different things","we needed to do and get them to review the work, uh because one of the problems we were having with them was we would hand over the paperwork, the drafts that we had done and it was pretty clear when we met","with them that they hadn't looked at any of the drafts. So we sort of had to get them to focus and I tried to do that uh personally with them uh to make sure that we were going to meet our objectives and",4,5.1
"04_segment-04","I was recently asked by SWS here at ETS that strategic work force solutions, our human resources group uh to negotiate a contract with a person who runs a negotiation company. So I knew","that this was not going to be easy because I actually had attended this person's class a few years ago and I knew that he was really smart and very well vast in negotiation and I thought","Oh, I'm I trying to negotiate a contract with him to do work here is going to be pretty interesting. Uh I had received uh this individual's contract which was one page long and my job was","to get him to sign our contract which is about twenty pages long with a statement of work that had another probably five or six pages to it. Uh So you know, he had a pretty simple idea of","how this might work and we had a much complicated idea. Uh What I tried to do was to take the information from his one page and incorporate it into ours and make changes to our contract.","That would make him feel that we were listening to what he was saying uh and in a bit that, in a way that kind of back fired because I gave a lot to him before we got started and then when","I tried to get from him the things that were important to us he was really fighting back with me. Uh So in the end uh he got a lot more out of this than we got but I did try by sending him","red line agreements, by uh explaining things in email and also over the phone to him why these things were important to ETS and what we were trying to uh get for us that we thought was not","really hurting him. Uh We did end up signing a contract uh actually a day after this person started here doing the work. Uh It looks like the work is going to be successful uh and we","already paid him a fair amount of money for the first day that he was here. So we have a signed contract, uh didn't get everything that we wanted but I think in the end uh it will be a good",4,5.2
"04_segment-05","I was asked to work on a contract with one of our accounting firms um for some work that they were going to be doing overseas for us, and what happened was they gave me a copy of their contract um and asked,","I was asked to look at it but not spend a lot of time on it and not make a lot of changes to it because our internal finance people really just wanted to get this signed. Um So I said to them, Well you know,","I really need to read the whole thing over and give you my comments. And I talked to my senior director about this and we agreed that I would do my normal job of reviewing everything. I'll point out all the","items that we thought we important and then the finance people would decide which ones they really wanted to go back to the, the accounting firm on. So I went through everything, I had to do it really quickly","because they originally gave me about two and a half days to work on this and then came back and said they needed it in a day. Um and I actually had to negotiate that with my internal client because I had a","meeting that morning and I couldn't get this finished until the afternoon. But anyway I ended up giving them feedback on ten different pieces of the contract that um my director and I thought were important.","And I think probably about five of them were actually accepted by the accounting firm. Uh so that was a good thing, they didn't put everything into the agreement the way I was expecting them to do it but they","did find a way to insert our comments on that they were agreeable to. And I think that we have a pretty good contract with this group. Um interestingly there were some typos in what the finance people thought","was the final agreement and so I pointed out to them where these typos were because I though if this goes up to the vice president and the vice president sees these mistakes I'm going to be blamed for it. So","I wanted to be sure that this was a good document uh that everybody could live with in the end.

And uh in the past uh when I was working on those letters I sometimes had to negotiate with our Rabbi or with our Kantra on what","some of the wording would be, um how we were going to put this together. And um and when we had a new Rabbi come a few years ago I showed","him the letters and I said I think we really need to make this first letter much shorter. So I showed him where I thought that we could","extract information or delete information so that we could get this to a shorter uh page number, number of pages. Um And he was agreeable","to do that which made me very happy. So uh we made the deletions, we got this letter down to about four pages, it used to be five pages.","I'm pretty sure that most people don't read the letter when they get it so I feel bad about that because we do do a lot of work on it.

"04_segment-07","We've probably all experienced working for a boss that we didn't like or uh in some ways didn't respect very much. Uh and when I worked at City Group, I worked for about six months under a person who uh came to us on","Halloween and we decided that she was a witch. Uh we really did not like working with her. Uh and what we found was she always thought that she was right about everything. Uh she worked about twenty five hours everyday and","expected the rest of us to do that as well, and uh she watched over us, made comments that we stayed at lunch too long or left work on what she thought was early when actually it was not usually early. Uh [and she], I","guess the hardest thing for us was that she would give us multiple projects to work on and never prioritized which one she wanted done first. So I would say to her, Well, you know, I have three projects here that you want","me to do, which one is the most important? And her answer usually was, They're all important and you have to do all of them immediately. Uh so what I did was just use my best judgment in that case to try to get things done","as quickly as I could uh and hand them over to her and say, you know, Here we are, this one is done. I'll work on the next one. Uh that was kind of the only way that I could get through working with her because I'm a","person who likes very much to have organization and I felt like I couldn't work on three things at once uh in the way that she wanted me to do because I wasn't going to get them all done at the same time. Uh so anyway uh","there was one day when uh this person asked me to update some PowerPoint presentations that I had previously done, and I asked her when she needed them and she said she needed them that day, including some new ones that I","hadn't ever worked on before.

So that was kind of interesting, uh but I felt like I was very much freed from uh captivity when I wasn't having to work",4,3.4
"04_segment-08","uh This question is about being given more than your share of unpleasant tasks. And I guess I wouldn't really say this was an unpleasant task, but it was something I was hoping that we wouldn't have to do. um We have a","file room in our area and the file room kept getting full and they had to um bring in more file cabinets and move things outside of the file room. So we finally uh were told that we were going to have a file cleanup","day, and I got really nervous about this because we were each going to be given uh a shelf of files and that meant that my files were interspersed among all of the people who were going to do this project and I was a","little bit nervous about what was going to happen to the files that I'm responsible for. So the first thing that I did was I ran into the file room, I grabbed all my really important files, I put them on my desk and I","said, I'll do these myself. um And then on the day of file cleanup we had all of our instructions, what we were supposed to do. um And I ran into the file room, grabbed part of the, a shelf full of files, went back to","my desk and organized all over my desk um different piles so that I wouldn't get things confused. um And I spent the day working on this, I thought that it was going to take about two hours to do the file room cleanup,","my part of it, but it actually took the entire day and we almost didn't finish by the end of the day um which was kind of scary. um But anyway I was happy with the job I did. I thought that I did a good job of cleaning","the files.

So it's a little bit frustrating that not, that the entire group didn't take it as seriously as I","think they should have. um But at least I know that uh when I grab the folders, the new folders that I haven't touched before um that I'm able to put them in the right order now and um hopefully none of our files will",4,4.8
"04_segment-09","uh One of the people that I worked under at Prudential um was that the vice president of our uh procurement area, [and I started working under her] um one year","that, I've worked directly for the vice, another vice president and they um changed the organization. So now I was working for this woman Mary um and I thought","that was going to be okay until I started going to her staff meetings and realized that whenever Mary posed a problem and I gave a suggestion for how it might be","solved she totally dismissed it. um She never listened to any of the ideas that I had and I sort of sat around, sat in the room looking around realizing that","nobody else was ever making any suggestions and that they were kind of the Stepford Wives. You know, they were all just um you know in this meeting and looking at","Mary thinking that she was wonderful and not really offering very much in the way of suggestions or ideas. So um after a while of feeling like I was batting my","head against the wall I decided, Maybe I should just stop making suggestions because she's not going to be listening to them anyway. And um even though in","retrospect, and as I'm saying this it doesn't sound like that was a really good idea to do, um it really made me feel better because I felt like, you know, at","least I wasn't putting myself out there and being beaten up every time I try to um give an idea. Or not so much beaten up but really more ignored, um I didn't","feel that that felt good so I decided if I just kept quiet about things and did my job and didn't offer suggestions that probably everybody could be happier. So",4,1.9
"04_segment-10","When I was um an associate manager at Prudential I was offered the opportunity to attend the train the trainers session for our premier management training program. And some of","the people who were in the train the trainer session had actually attended the management training program as participants and about half of us had not attended in the past.","And I was in the group that had never been through this workshop, so not only were we being asked to learn how to train the workshop but we really had to understand the content","of the workshop at the same time. um There was an activity that we were doing um that talked about goals and objectives and they had two people go up to the front of the room,","actually it was three. It was um the seller and two buyers in this exercise. And they were, the seller was trying to sell an orange and the two buyers were trying to each buy","the orange for very good humanitarian reasons. And they each had their own little script and at one point while they were talking I heard distinctly that one of the people said","I need the juice of the orange. And the other person wasn't picking up on it and so I wasn't actually in the middle of doing this um exercise, I was watching it. But I realized","Oh, the other person needs the right of the orange, and that is the solution to the whole problem. They can share the orange because each of them needs a different part. So um","in my work and in my um whole life I try very hard to listen carefully when people are talking because many times there is a clue even if it's a very small clue in what they","are saying that helps you to solve a problem later on um because you've listened carefully and you've detected some little piece of information that maybe other people have not",4,5.5
"04_segment-11","I guess uh in my work life I've always tried to avoid having difficult situations happen so that that then I don't have to tell my boss about the","difficult problem that's occurred or that I can go in and say this is a problem that we potentially had but we've resolved it, we've gotten around it.","Uh I did have a boss once who uh, we were in a line division at Prudential. There were about fifty people PIP paying claims in our group. There was a","claims supervisor who had been there for many years and she was very knowledgeable about the work. Uh I was more of an administrative person as was my","boss. My boss never had anything on his desk. He had a black desk with a black water and you never saw a white piece of paper on his desk. So you can","imagine how he felt when he looked out of the office of his window at this  claim supervisor who's desk was fully covered with paper, large piles of","staff books, all kinds of things all over her desk. And it made him crazy. So he came to me one day and he said tome, You have to get Terry to clean her","desk. And I basically said to him there is really no way that I'm going to be able to get her to clean that desk. She knows where everything is, she can","get her hands on things immediately and I know that's not the way that you work or the way that you would like your desk to look but it works for her","and I don't think we're going to change her after all these years. So I think he wasn't really happy with what I said to him but Terry got to keep her",4,4.8
"04_segment-12","I don't know if you've ever um had any experience with a system called DocuSign which is a document signature system that we adopted a couple of years ago here at ETS. And all of our contracts go through the DocuSign","system to be fully executed and it's great because in the end everybody can get a copy of, um everybody who you want to can get a copy of the executed agreement. um What we learned was there were other uses for DocuSign,","it didn't have to be just document signatures. There could be other things that we could do with it. um So I uh teamed up with a person in our group who really is the DocuSign expert, the person who negotiated the","contract with DocuSign. And he and I have been doing some special projects to try to figure out how we can use DocuSign to streamline some of our other work. One of the things that we came up with was sending out our","supplier forms that we need for accounts payable and for our contract management system to our suppliers through DocuSign. And so uh Bill and I spent quite a bit of time going over all the forms coming up with um","revisions to the forms that would make sense when they were in DocuSign. um And then and we had to negotiate that with the owners of the forms. And then when we were all done um when we came up with the process we had to","present this to our group, to procurement and also the contract managers. um What Bill and I did before that was we knew that everything was set in the DocuSign system but we sat down just the two of us and rehearsed how","we were going to do this, exactly what order we were going to do it in, how he and I would show the different pieces of the system and the different um uh people who would be involved and how they would fill out the forms","electronically. um And we had to this to our group, with our group who of course sat there and said it's a whole lot easier for just, for us just to email these things than it is to put this DocuSign thing together. um So","we had some um push, push back from people on using this in the first place but fortunately our management was really behind it and we do have our whole group now using DocuSign for supplier forms and also for our uh",4,4.7

I help focus the leader on um providing the","input needed from an executive uh view point. uh My role","usually is as a support person however it is an important","role. uh It does provide me with um more of a background on","what the project is.

"05_segment-02","So I am the liaison for ETS cares for my department, corporate accounting. Uh And uh when I","began at ETS in twenty-twelve, uh I was told that uh I would lead the department and uh be the","liaison for corporate accounting, and so I came up with some pretty um interesting ideas. The","department I work in uh really needed a cheer leader and uh to get them motivated to","participate uh and I am very proud to say that in the last two years, uh we've been number one","in finance. Uh I have done things like uh donated uh bags of potato chips and the people had","put in the ETS cares piggy bank uh money to get back the potato chips. So that kind of brought","our uh donations up. And we had a uh dress-down day uh where they could wear like the college","sweat shirt or anything of their choice uh for the day for a certain theme, uh and that also","brought our donations up uh on behalf of our department. So it's been a very positive uh ETS",5,5.6
"05_segment-03","So about uh twelve years ago, I worked at um a company where the","project lead and his boss were not on the same page, um and it","was a lot of um tension and so uh each one would come to me","complaining about the other. um I made it a point of not taking","sides. I thought it was best that I just remain neutral about the","situation. um If one of them started um saying things about the","other that I did not think was professional, I just nicely told","them to leave me out of it, I did not want to be involved. um It","really did get to a point where it was unprofessional and um so I","just made sure that both of them were aware that I did not want",5,3.4
"05_segment-04","So as a new employee um, one of the things that uh I had to do","was gain the trust of my department. um [And] just so they would","know my capabilities, what I can do, what I can uh do as I","represent them outside the department. um So one of my attributes","I guess is that uh I have patience and I listen to people's","concerns, uh what they are looking for, their needs, and then I","make sure that I um do whatever background uh information that I","can get my hands on, so that they understand um That my skills,","my background, uh I can absolutely do the job that needs to be","done. And it's been a pretty positive um outcome the few times",5,5.1
"05_segment-05","So I worked in as a project management coordinator uh about mmm thirteen years ago, and uh one","of the tasks uh I had or one of the projects I was assigned is to uh supervise and help close","twenty projects that were outstanding uh in one year. And so, when I took a look at some of the","projects uh that the department wanted closed, I realized that between uh the lack of personnel","or the personnel that we had there were on vacation. Uh There was a lot of uh people who were","unable to help provide the support that was needed. Uh And so I sat down with my department","division manager and we went through and we picked the ones that we knew we could uh close that","year, and then we put a project plan in place for the other uh projects. So in that year we","were able to close twelve projects and the other eight were closed the following year. Uh So it","wasn't the twenty in one year that uh the department manager wanted, but we did get twenty in",5,4.2
"05_segment-06","So I put together a proposal on a process improvement project um and before I","presented it, I did a lot of background and research on how this process would help","stream line the department. um  It would cut back on errors done, it would also um","give the group um more time to work on other projects uh and provide uh financial","improvement. So I saved about uh two hundred and fifty thousand um with this","process improvement and it was something that I presented to the entire department.","um First I presented it to my manager um and then I presented it to um his direct","reports, um and then I presented it to the entire department to get feedback","because they are the end users. So I needed to know if there was something that I","was missing. But um  we did implement the process and um I actually got an award",5,5.4
"05_segment-07","So um I work with many different personalities and so um within my spectrum um I need to be able to","interact with all different types. So we have um people who are very detailed, um and people who are","more um laid back and just um relaxed about uh things. So when I try to adjust my personalities so","that um when I'm working with different personality types, I can um absolutely work with them on a","professional level. uh [And deal with] um [the different levels of] uh I've worked with everyone from","someone who is very very detailed oriented to someone who is kind of doesn't, very relaxed and doesn't","really look at the nature of details. So um I've successfully worked with them, uh and I keep it","strictly professional depending on the personality type. uh But um overall I say it was a successful","blending. um I knew that um the people who were more detail oriented um just needed uh to know that I","could provide the support that they needed. um So I've never had an issue with interacting with",5,5.3
"05_segment-08","So um the task that uh in the past that I've handled was uh providing um IDs. The stars","on new employees and um it's one of those that is a necessary task that needs to be","done. um And so I made sure I always tracked uh the number of IDs that I did, versus the","amount that was handed out that day. So if there was uh twenty that were handed out and","I did fifteen, then I would absolutely call a meeting uh depending on if this was a","consistent um day after day situation. um And then I would make sure that the group","understood that this was a shared task, um and that we really needed  to uh get together","as a team, to make sure that these task weren't just handed onto one person and didn't","necessarily have to be myself. um If I saw the task was being primarily handled by","another person, I would um make sure that the team was aware of this and as a group um",5,5.6
"05_segment-09","So I had a manager one time uh who um ignored the um standard operating","procedure that they had just um published and signed off on. So um I","privately made an appointment with this person um and privately um just","wanted to discuss uh the procedure and I wanted them to help me understand","what had happened. um It turns out that uh the person just was not even","aware that they had just broken their own procedure. um So the situation was","um rectified and the manager actually uh put out an apology to the group um","and acknowledging that um they went against standard operating procedure.","But I wasn't sure at the time that I had done the right thing um by going to","them and to just point out an error but they handled it well and it was uh",5,5.3
"05_segment-10","So there was an issue that came up um when a manager uh sent out an email to the entire","department, uh almost reprimanding them. Uh and so a few people came to me and asked me what's","going on? So I went to the manager and sat down uh with him and just said help me understand uh","what happened here. They started uh talking to me about the issue, and how unhappy they were with","this issue. So I didn't say anything but just kind of let them uh vent. And it turns out that the","person wasn't so much uh I don't want to say angry, but uh turns out it was more a uh De-concern","for the department and what was going on. And so I worked with this person on uh making sure that","uh the communications were uh sent out, that contained a hostile message. So I wanted this person","to understand as I listened to them and I grew to understand where their concerns were coming","from, that maybe we could draft up a different kind of communication for the department. uh Which",5,5.2
"05_segment-11","So um there have been a lot of times that um I've been asked to provide feedback for my immediate supervisor um and","especially as an administrative assistant,um  you have a different working relationship with a person um you get to","know them on the business side and also on a personal side too. um So it never fails that they will ask for feedback um","from me in some form or another, either informally or formally um and so I'm always open and honest with them, um but I","remain professional. uh I like to joke and kid but if they are asking me or I'm providing their supervising feedback on","them, I do keep it professional. um I don't bring up, you know uh they were in a bad mood on such and such a day. um  I","do listen to what the department says, but I don't let it influence me. Their interaction with other people, um how","they are with them as a manager, not just with me but with their direct in. um So  I try to let them know what the","positive outcome and some of their strengths and some things they can improve on. I have one supervisor who just did","not want to interact with people and so I told her that it was important that her department got to know her on a",5,5.9
"05_segment-12","So I have recently uh began uh transitioning some of the forms that we have uh within my department um","into InfoPath forms put on share point. And so um I had I could correspond with one of my co-workers to","help them understand InfoPath forms because uh they really wanted to get to uh work with it and use it.","But they had no idea on how to uh use the actual program itself. So I thought it was best to have me make","sometime, sit down with the computer, and go through step by step what I did uh to create a form in","InfoPath to put on to share point. Uh this person doesn't uh have a strong background in uh programs he","knows excel very well. But uh InfoPath is not something that someone knows a lot of and so especially","when you are dealing with uh different financial forms. Then you want to make sure that certain things","get in certain things aren't. So as we are going through and this is an on going project so uh I'm","supporting her and what she needs and uh so she's starting to get her forms together with my help and",5,4.8
"06_segment-01","So five years back when my job was moved outsource to accenture I was moved to another group which was uh totally different from my previous group. So I was trained for","the new work while I was getting trained I noticed that they had all the documents or uh all the files located in share drives which was not, version controlled and not","secure as well. And I came from a group where we were using share-point for all, for the security and version control features. So I mentioned it to my manager, should I","try to bring that here as well in this group and uh the group was about maybe 18 people in the team and my manager said okay you take a lead leadership of this uh task and","go ahead with it. So I met with each and every member of the team, I showed them what we can do and why we should move on to share-point is because, [we can use], if","somebody makes a change and we can go back and check different previous versions. [We can], uh these files which are in share-point sites are very secure. So I met with","each of them got a rubber file structure and designed a share-point site for them. Although, right now you would see there is a lot of assistance provided if you have to","do the same task, but five years back there was not much assistance so I was knocking on every door that I could, get the information, work with the entire team, one on","one and also with the whole group as to, uh this is how the design looks like, would you be like, would you like me to make any changes? Are you comfortable using it? So","the whole transition from share drives to share-point was the task that I took on my own and worked as a leader, trained the entire team to use it. They are comfortably",6,6.3
"06_segment-02","Two-thousand eleven I was working on a six Sigma project and my project was to find out what are the tasks which are been done repeatedly in two groups because under my group there were packaging and package testing","groups. So what are the tasks that they are repeating in both the groups, because we were separated before so we were uh doing some of the things which are uh repeated kind of. So the two both the entire, both the teams","were doing the same task. So, I was supposed to meet both the teams and find out why they were doing that and what we can eliminate or add to save some time and also save resources in doing the task which is not necessary.","During that time we figured that there were lot of issues because we were saying that this task takes this much time and then we came up with in the team meetings we came up with other situation where it was taking long","for the team to handle the work because of the issues coming from different departments. I won't say exactly the department but I can give an example like I-base or AD or IT, those kind of places. The issues were, uh","rooting out from. So, I worked with the team and I said how can we handle the situation, where we can eliminate that as well. We can reach out to these departments and ask them and show them actual data as to what we are","having problems with. Maybe they can find out the solution maybe we won't have those problems again. So the team said okay, we have, we need all these information to uh put it into a database and pull the data and send it","to different groups and uh you know, maybe in quarterly basis we can reach out to other groups. So I sat with the team built uh MSAC, access application where they provided me with the information that they would like to","save and I created that application and I showed them how they can fetch data. I wrote them sequels from there they could fetch data for on quarterly basis and reach out to different groups and send them to uh keep track a","of what is going on, how things need to be improved at their end to help us at the end. So this has been used for maybe more than three years now and their task is getting easier and easier day by day as other groups are",6,4.7
"06_segment-03","Working for uh more than eleven years at ETS or twelve years at ETS I have seen from time to time people who are not very happy with what, with","their situation or not very happy working with others in general or maybe with someone. So, but then when I approach them, my approach is like,","maybe you would think that it is a friendly approach but it is, I would talk um to the person about work and no matter how I can get the information","from the person and sometimes what I do is, if it is work related and it needs to be done, I sit with both first people um separately not in the","same room because I tried that in the same room and talking to both of them at the same time and sometimes it didn't work out. What it was, the","tension they had or whatever background they had with each other uh would not let them work together. So I would try to sit with each of them","separately, get the information, get the work done, uh handle them separately instead of putting them in the same group, in the same room and handle","them together at the same time. Because no matter what, sometimes you just cannot make the person change their behavior. The work needs to be done","and that I take care of, that it is getting done. um It's the approach that I take that I get the information from both the parties and put it","together, make sure that they are not offended by what I'm trying to do, um get their permission to do that and explain to them the reason for doing",6,4.8
"06_segment-04","So January of twenty twelve we had uh a new application that came out iPackager which was replacing test prep. Uh The team IT team who developed it gave us a training for two days on how","to use this new application and how to move on from test prep to iPackager. But there was a feature auto clone which was not incorporated in that release. In January of twenty-twelve","although it came in at the end of the year, by the end of the year we got that auto clone feature. Without that auto clone feature what we had to do is, to build a package, a test package.","There were more than two hundred fields that need to be filled with data and when I sat for the two-day training I figured that it's going to take forever for every person in the team to","do it manually, enter two hundred fields to build one test package. It's very time consuming, there can be human errors. So, I planned to automate the whole process. But since it was all","production involvement, people were not willing to take it, uh take my idea of uh  automating the whole process. So, I asked them for two days, two weeks, and build my code in uh some test","which is like sequence plus code and did a demo for the IT team who developed the iPackager application. When I showed them what it can do, how it can take all the data from test prep and","put it in iPackager, which, uh uh manually a person may take more than two days to build one package, my code was taking thirty minutes to build the entire package. When I gave them the","demo, they were one hundred percent convinced that this is the best approach to take. And since they were uhconvinced by my idea, my team had to take it because it was coming now from IT","group as to take it. So the whole team agreed to use the uh script that I built for them and the entire year the whole, my code was used to built over six hundred packages by using the",6,5.5
"06_segment-05","So I was, since I knew access development, there was an application or is an application to support AP Chinese and Japanese, uh dashboard creation that is been","created from that application. And the team who developed it, the person who developed it or the people who are using the reports dashboards to send out to the VPs","or the executive managers for, at the end of the day they were not um working together well. So I was given this project and told take care of it. But, when I","entered the room where the parties were looking at each other and saying we want this and the other one was, this is not possible and that kind of situation. I","started arranging meetings with them and taking meeting notes, uh sharing with the teams. And asking them about what changes they would like to have and how much","time I have or this person have to provide those changes to the application. We uh came to a mutually favorable outcome was that we can provide them with certain","features but not all of them. And at the end of the maybe March or February we start sending, February or March we start sending the dashboards. By then we had","everything ready and then after May when we had more time we started working on the new features that they were asking for. And, that they asked for before so that","way I had documented everything all the meeting minutes, the current working of the application, the new, uh uh add-ons that they wanted new. uh Features that they","wanted, I documented everything and the task was taken very smoothly from there on after we started meeting and getting together in the meeting rooms and doing the",6,5.9
"06_segment-06","A year ago I was moved on to mumble production group where I noticed that uh many reports were built on most on a weekly basis or some are built daily basis to report the","status of different uh test centers.

When I noticed that how long a person sits and makes","the report, by fetching data from different sources, putting them together, doing the uh capacity utilization percentages and uh showing the uh different colors for uh","different percentages like if it is greater than seventy, showing red or if it is greater than sixty show it yellow, something like that. When I sat with a couple of people","and I noticed how much time they are spending on it, I came up with an idea of writing macros for report creation. In the beginning they were a little hesitant about using","them because it would take away their manual task, it will not let the new person know what exactly we are doing, just like clicking on a mac, you know click run a macro one","click and it will do the work which they are spending hours and hours will be done in a second. It was hard to convince the team, the people who were using it, one by one I","started talking to them, giving them a demo, showing them what I can do to help them. Documenting the steps for them, uh actually commenting my codes so that they can even","read and uh make little changes like, uh and a several being at some place and then re-run it again. So showing them small little stuff, how it can be used, now they are",6,6.2
"06_segment-07","So at ETS we work with the diverse group of people, and [everybody], um if they have a different cultural background, their way of handling","situation is different than my way so I take that into consideration. Sometimes when I approach somebody and I feel like they don't want to interact","with me or help me or are extremely busy. um I understand their situation and I give them sometime and [instead of], I'm a person who would walk to","the person and talk instead of doing that if I see there is a problem with that I would document things. I would write in an e-mail and um send an","e-mail to the person, um maybe one time, two time, if I don't get a response I would approach the person, walk again or give a call. Try to get the","work done no matter what it is, I mean we all have differences but if the work needs to be done it needs to be done. That's how I take it so, for me","I get paid for the work I'm doing here. um I live the cultural background or the differences of opinion or other personal matters stuff aside and","concentrate on the work. um It's not very difficult to get the work done if you can put down in a um bullet form. This is what I need, this is what","I need and please provide me. If that is your approach which is not um too much for the other person to drop what they are doing right away and give","it to you, then they will definitely get back to you.

"06_segment-08","Well, most of the time I'm not aware of what other employees are doing even if they are in my team. so I cannot compare the situation, and uh any task which is tedious,","boring or physically demanding since I can code, I try to make it not tedious, not boring or not physically demanding. I try to automate the processes, and I shouldn't be","telling you but I do it click and I can walk away, take a break and come when the work is done, that's the kind of background I have. um But uh if the task is too much then","I try working from home in the week, in the evenings or in the weekends and I do at my own schedule.

I mean I can work a little bit over the weekend and in the evenings so and the task that I get. If it is","tedious, boring, physically demanding I find out a way to make it interesting for me because when I write code and I, it starts working I feel happy to look at it and to see","how um successfully I'm handling the job. [Like a little task of] um [putting the keys on], um we had a huge list of thousand of uh test center administrators and if the","e-mail address is same, then we have to put the one, two, three, four and others.

I spend","maybe two hours to write a macro but it one click and it just looks at uh a match, or if it sees an exact mark with the previous record it just puts like the numbering one,","two, three, four and then the next fifth one is not a match it will put one there.

There is an application which is developed in MS access uh by some other","team member. And, I was told by that team member to take care of uh the closed CPRs or you can say closed tickets. Pull the closed tickets out of the database and uh put it in a text TXT","format and give it to another team which was taking, which had built another application where they wanted it in TXT format and then, the special type of uh delimiter that they wanted it","and the special uh fields that they wanted in a special format.

And when I asked the person have you ever done it before, the person mentioned yeah, it can be done through task","scheduler and I have to, uh I had to confess at that time I haven't used task scheduler before could you please help me with that.

So I spoke to the developer person in the other group and I sat with them, I said you tell me what you want, how do you want.

"06_segment-11","So, at ETS uh or I think at every other workplace you would definitely see some uhpeople who click very well and some people who just cannot. Uh One of the situations I was in","was I developed MS access application where the data needs to be input by the team members on a package is built. But there were these problems and these problems took this long","to be handled. And this is where the problem erupted from. So uh the manager put on person, uh to take care of the situation like enter data. You are the person who will enter","the data. We could tell the situation was like  she wanted to promote the person, she liked the person and she wanted to do it fine, that happens everywhere. And I see it around","happening all the time, but then the other team members started coming to me and saying the data which is being put in is incorrect and we will look bad if this data goes out of","our team, we are saying incorrect things here, what to do. So I approached my manager and I tried to explain to her about the situation. We know that this person uh is very","knowledgeable but also he's knowledgeable on his on program but he is not working on other programs. So, how about we give this task to everybody in the team, whoever is a lead","of particular program. Like if he is TOEIC lead so he can do only for TOEIC because he would understand TOEIC better than TOEFL, GRE HiSET. So how about the lead should be","allowed to do that, and it was a difficult communication I would say because I find it more difficult when I see that the manager is trying to do something and, we can see it's","coming, but the approach is incorrect.

But then when the other","person reads it sometimes it's hard for them and particularly when they are not very technical or not even that, but I feel that there are all kinds of people.","Some are very aggressive in learning something new, others are very um slow and don't care and like we are all, working for a place where it doesn't matter","whether you take something new or you don't.

So","that there is a seamless transition to the information that you are providing to your team um that they would also receive from their management. um I feel that over the past uh","years that I have served that role that uh we had some great successes and I'll say we have really mastered um that ability to civilly show that without having any formal um",8,5.2
"08_segment-02","Working in the resolutions department, we come across a variety of different issues and and errors that come about through the various different testing streams that we accommodate and help","support. When these errors occur, uh it creates a uh large amount of additional work, it creates manual intervention, quality control, other sorts of actions that you need to take to remediate","the situation and uh successfully deliver a finished product or scores or whatever you are looking to accomplish. uh Most of the time um when we have these issues we need to rally a large","quantity of staff to perform sometimes road exercises in terms of quality control or updating of certain records or demographic information. When you get that large group together, you really","need to have a goal in mind and [it's] clear thought process of how you're going to tackle these large scale projects.

You really have to break yourself away from the personal issues of it.

"08_segment-04","I've been a member of uh the test taker resolution services for about seven or eight years now, and over the course of that tenure, we've had a lot of different changes that have taken place that","we've had to communicate to staff a variety of different levels. Where this comes into the negotiation part, is that often times when changes occur, especially organization changes, shifting","responsibilities or programs, it's very similar to a negotiation when you meet a variety of different staff about it. Because you are trying to negotiate with them to have them buy into this new","idea and a key component of whether or not they're going to buy into this, is whether or not they trust you. The trust part is I think the most critical part in negotiation in general but","especially when it comes to things like changes. Trust is something that you have to, they had to build over time um and it's something you have to work on and show results, show clear cut results","uh based upon actions, promises, uh conversations that you have.

That level of trust has built over a longer period of time, so that when we go and we communicate these things, you are going","to leverage that trust that you build up to get people to negotiate with them to buy into the fact that these changes that we are making is either good for everyone or good for these people or good","for these program. For other items, uh smaller term negotiations it may just be as simple as uh you follow it up on the email that you said you were going to so that when you call your prospective","client back and you start negotiating with them more, they trust that at least in the first instance you followed up and you said, you did what you said you were going to do. um So that might be",8,5
"08_segment-05","Anytime you want to ask me a question about bargaining or compromising, one thing I always think about is when uh you go and you purchase a car. uh About a year and a half ago, two years ago in","two thousand twelve. I went and I purchased a new car. So I go into the lot and I find a car and I like this car and this is the car I want. I looked at a few other cars and I said no, this one","car this one dealership, this is the car I want. So I'm now in the situation where I have someone else to sell me a car, I have a car I want to buy. The car is in the lot and I have the money. So","we sit down and they start giving you all these information about all sorts of things, how they come up with their price, what are all these services, what are these packages, how does this","package link to this other package, why you need this service or this add on. um I remember sitting there for a good hour listening to all this and you're trying to scramble and you are asking","all these questions. But really what came down to is what do I want to pay? Right. I kind of took a step back and said okay, what do I want out of this? What is the most important thing to me?","And I said okay I want the cheapest price possible. Well and what's the most important thing for mumble across the way for me, right which is to make a profit not only his company but himself? So","I kind of realized in that situation okay, at some level he needs to make money and at some level I need a good price. So once I decided what I want in terms of the price and said this is what I","feel comfortable paying, what can you do to make that happen? He was about to construct a deal that will end up enough with my goals, where I got out of it what I wanted, and I was happy with","what I was paying. Regardless of any of the other factors I was okay with it and he got out of it what he needed which was he structured a deal that was going to make him look good or whatever",8,5.8
"08_segment-06","This is a topic I feel really comfortable talking about, uh in my tenure we've had a lot of different um issues or requests for changes. And anytime that happens, a major component","in the request for change involves processes designed and system architecture and making changes to certain things. Often certain times when you get in these situations, you have","different groups within your organization that have different ideas about how they should proceed with the change. Part of my role through out my career has been to develop these","changes reviewing them with different groups and getting them to buy in with, this is the proposal that we need to go with. There is a few ways that uh I feel that I do extremely","extremely well at to make that happen. One I'm a firm believer that you really need to understand the subject matter of what you're talking about. Why you're making these changes and","what exactly is your change going to do to fix um that problem. Every proposal out there is basically to change or fix an existing problem, or do something better. So if you really","understand the subject matter and you really understand exactly what your change is going to do. Then the next step really is to clearly communicate that to an appropriate audience.","Being able to change your message whether it be to lowest level of technology people or high level executives um and then be ready and prepared to defend and respond to questions and","inquiries uh about your particular proposal or change or contractor, whatever the situation is. But I think it all really goes back to subject matter, really being the subject matter","expert and kind of going back to what we talked about before, if you can build trust through subject matter expertise, people are going to be more likely to buy into your proposal",8,5.8
"08_segment-07","I think you're going to have a lot of situations occur where you are going to have to work with people that you don't get along with. And dealing","with that is a huge component to success. I believe a major contributor to how successful you're going to be is what is the variety of people that","you can work with. Because if you can work with a variety of people, then you can leverage a variety of skills knowledge based expertise, to uh","loop into project or assessment based work, and produce the best results possible. When you come across people that don't, aren't traditionally","people that others enjoy working for. I think the key is to differentiate those individuals that really have a firm grasp of the knowledge and or","has a firm, a large amount of expertise, and really determining out of these individuals that who I don't particularly enjoy working with, what","are the things that I know I can rely on them to do?  What are the things that I can respect them and acknowledge in them that they do well and","what can I focus on to make the relationship as positive as possible? Even if they're items that I don't particularly care for, um maybe there is","other parts of these people that I can really um leverage and really use and try to focus on that and really just keep everything on a forward","looking um progression so that you're constantly looking towards the next goal and you're not overly criticizing people for previous mistakes or",8,5.4
"08_segment-08","I don't think I have a personal situation where I was involved in something like this. So instead let me tell you the advise that I would give to an employee of mine","or a prospective ah friend or colleague who is looking for a job or was in a new role. So if you are in a situation that you feel that you are, for anything maybe it's","not even unpleasant task that you are getting more work or more responsibility or more um tedious or demanding work than other employees. My advice to people is always","to keep an open line of communication with your direct management. A lot of times people can get myopic in their focus and often times they are not in the position to","truly understand why um certain decisions are being made, so it's very possible that there is a really good reason why you might have a different set of task than","other people and it might actually be a good thing that you are getting more of the unpleasant task, than another person. If these tedious boring tasks involve a lot","of subject matter and quality control, it might be because your manager, or your supervisors really value this work that you are doing and you are able to show this","great results. um I think that if you keep the line of communication open, and when you talk about it, if you talk about it in a positive way, and in a way that says I","just want open communication about this, I'm here as a team player and always position yourself as a team player.

"08_segment-09","Again I don't believe I have a personal story to share about this particular situation, so I'll speak about this in a broader sense and some of my view points on","this sort of situation. Uh I firmly believe that leaders especially uh those that are placed in the leadership of a group, do have some leeway to make changes,","and often times they need to make changes. With that being said there is always a give and take in terms of of how drastic the change need to be and what input","the leader gets from those uh contributions. I think from the view point of someone who is part of this group, and has made contributions, when the leadership","changes and a change of direction is made, I think that it's an opportunity to really make some critical self reflection and say, is this really the right","direction for the group? Does this change or the uh dropping of certain contributions, uh does this actually make more sense? Is the new opinion or the new","direction better than the previous direction or is it just different? And you know if it's different, can you still be a part of that, can you still buy into","that. Your job is to be a team player, your job is to uh be part of this project to show results, to solve the problem or issues or service the client that your","company has put you in uh and uh part of the job is to work with the leadership in accordance with that.

"08_segment-10","In test taker services we use a large amount of agency staff due to the peaks and valleys of our processes and cycles and the programs that we support. With this influx of","new staff uhwe have to be very adapt to training staff, bring them on board, teaching them subject matter knowledge that they need to do, communicating with them and","telling them exactly what the tasks are that we need to accomplish. Through that exchange, often times we have communication issues and minor communication problems and me","personally as a manager in test taker services I often have to rely on my listening skills to really take a moment and hear the issues or the complaints that people are","bringing to me. To really dissect and figure out what is the root nature of the problem.

Which is very different than the","message they were communicating. So really listening and analyzing and hearing out what people are saying to you.

This","creates a very uh tense situation especially when myself as a manager reading from my previous experience as a program coordinator, would get all the information about an error and","then would have to go and communicate that not only to my direct supervisor but also top level management. And it can be very stressful and it can be very uh sensitive. One of the","the things I feel that is really important when delivering this type of issue is really understanding the scope of the issue, and really understanding what needs to happen to","contain the issue. Anytime that there is an issue that arises you have to communicate this type of information, you need to be able to assure people that you fully understand how","big the issue is and what exactly are the steps that you're going to have to contain it.

I speak with entry level ETS regular staff, I speak","with midtear ETS staff, I speak with ETS upper management, I communicate with vendors. A variety of different audiences with a vastly different realm of technical","expertise, and knowledge specially to our process. uh When I come across these situations where I need to explain these technical or complex items to audiences I feel","that may or may not be as technical, I try to break things down to the process level.

"09_segment-01","uh When I first began my teaching career uh I was at an independent school in New York City. And um I had entered into a foreign language department that was, um I","would say quite antiquated in some ways. And we needed to um take a look at the curriculum that we were using and potentially look at new text book uh adoption. So","although I was a new teacher I had gone through many teacher training classes. I had decided to uh sort of take the lead on reviewing text books, contacting the","publishers and doing a formal review of the text books that were currently in um the field at that time. uh That was very much when uh we were going into a lot of","using authentic materials in uh foreign language teaching. um I did a thorough review of approximately five different um text books from different editors and uh","at that point I had come to, I had to design a rubric that I used for the evaluation. um I then made a presentation um to my committee and to my colleagues. uh","Because you wanted to use it primarily for French which was my field. But the department chair also felt it was important that if we were going to make a change","that we could make the change across the board for all the Romance languages at that point. Which would have been French, German, Spanish and Italian. So I made a","form presentation to them, I presented the, uh my selected choice that I thought fit the criteria that we were looking for for the department. And then the","committee at that point uh decided to make a decision and um I was pleasantly surprised that they did agree and we did adopt this new formal um text book to be",9,6.3
"09_segment-02","uh During my career I spent uh several years as a head of an upper school in an independent school system. And um at that time we always had parent teacher conferences. And","these were the typical sort of led by the uh advisor of the student and the parents would come in, the student would be there. And it ended up being very much where the parent","and the uh teacher were having much more of the discussion and the student played a very uh background uh situation. Teachers at one point really were losing interest in this","advisory system. But I felt that as the leader of the division it was very important for us to have a program that was functional, that worked and that um actually focused on","the student. So what I had done was at that point I decided let's switch the roles of how we would have these advisory meetings. And we made them more student led so that the","student would be the one that would carry on the conversation. um And prior to those meetings there would be um specific tasks that each student would have to do in order to","prepare. They needed to set personal goals, academic goals, they needed to take a look at what they were hoping to accomplish for the year. uh What they envisioned might be","some of their pitfalls or some of their strengths. So that when we had the meeting, uh which happened actually twice a year. um It then became student led so that the student","was the one who was talking directly to the parent and he teacher then really became more of an advisor. So that they would interject from time to time, add some information.","But really it was a student having a strong discussion with the parents. Which was rather new since um that was not happening in the past and it gave the families some good",9,4.4
"09_segment-03","Uh during my career in education I was on several self studies of uh schools. And in one particular case I was at a uh school that was in uh the state of Arkansas.","And it was an independent school that was military based. There were three of us on this committee and we were looking at the governance section of the school. And a","portion of that also dealt with the student discipline. Um it was interesting in the fact that at this time and this was uh still dealing I would say in the nineteen","nineties. That there was corporal punishment being used at this institution. Uh And there was very much carry over from the uh military side of the institution. Uh My","other two colleagues had a very difficult time dealing with this. And they had um we spent many time in not really accomplish much, but more sort of in heavy duty","discussion. And so I thought one of the steps that we could take in order to complete the task of doing the review was, uh I had looked at what we needed to cover, I","broke it down into three distinct areas so that each one of us would be in charge of or responsible for one portion of the self study that we were doing. So that when","we came back at the end we then could share what we had discovered on our own private interviews, our own research. And then get together and to write up the section","that we needed to prepare for the self study. Um this way the other two members although they did not work well together on one project but when they each had their","individual piece. And then was able to work as a group and we all had to formulate the uh project and putting together on paper uh the recommendations that worked out",9,5.1
"09_segment-04","On one occasion as being a school leader um I had to deal with a situation that was quite challenging especially since it dealt with two veteran teachers. And these two","individuals had been at the school for um many years and certainly much longer than I had been there. But I came in as the leader and I needed to be able to work with","everyone. and of course as the um division head, trust was extremely important. So um in this situation we were dealing with the two that I, they had a difficult time um","working together and they shared for example um the eighth grade. The eight grade was divided into two sections, shall we just call it section A and section B and they","were both um in charge of each group, uh one per group rather excuse me. um But they really had many clashes along the way on general decisions that had to be made in","reference to the class. So what I tried to do was one we would have, we had several meetings along the way, where I had to bring them in together. um I wanted to make sure","that they did trust me so I wanted to listen to them first. Make sure that they had an understanding that I was under hearing them and trying to get to get to the, trying","to understand where they were coming from. But then I had to sort of negotiate and work with them and remind them at various times along these conversations where I've","just said we had had several. That they um had to kind of pull away from their personal bias and their personal um choices. And realize that our focus was the student,","we're the students in the classes and what they were doing. so that hopefully they could then see past what their personal issues were and regain focus at looking at what",9,5.2
"09_segment-05","Uh One of the most surprising times for me in schools came when we had to uh at the end of the year as a faculty get together and select award winners. Uh This is","where you would see in many cases there were a lot of personal teacher bias for certain students over other students. And what I did was in order to try make this a","fair sort of situation I had drawn up uh a list of criterion that I wanted to use during these discussions so that we would be able to look at each student","individually and see if they were meritorious of any sort of the awards that we had to distribute for our commencement exercises. Uh This at first became, uh was","not well accepted. They felt that I was coming in sort of very strong, very demanding and I wasn't giving them the opportunity to voice their own opinion. So what","we did was and I thought in reality this worked out very well was  that I took the list that I had drawn up. I broke them down into different groups so we had four","or five different groups working on this list. They did revisions, uh they added, subtracted, they put in uh things that they wanted to do uh or qualities and","expectations that they thought would be important. They brought that back to the group and then as a whole we were able to come up with a new document that we could","use that everyone felt comfortable with in choosing uh award winners for the various prizes that we had to offer at commencement. Uh I'm very glad that I backed","down and allowed them to do that because what would their buy in. This was something that we had established my first year at the school and for my time period",9,6.6
"09_segment-06","um As a college counselor in an independent school. um Our job, the job is very difficult in the respect that we need to be able to work with the families and with the","students as a partner. And um in this one presence in the school that I was in there were two of us who were working on college counseling. And we were working with uh","different groups of students. um The other individual had been doing this for quite some time and had her own system to work with. um And when I reviewed it and when I","looked at it um I had encountered and I felt some strong differences of opinions. And so what we needed to do was to sit down and to talk about it. And to really take a","look at why she was doing what she was doing? What was the the expected result? And was she reaching that result or reaching that goal. um And so what we ended up doing","was after several meetings, um I of course during that time was presenting my cases and how I wanted the system to change. Because for her it was becoming more that she","was the central figure in all of this. When in actuality it was more the family and the student who should have been the real focus. And so we um devised documentation","and a calendar that allowed us then to work together very collegiately. uh We had one joint meeting with the parents, in the very beginning both of us, even though it","wasn't my student or it may not have been her student. but the parents had heard from both of us and then we broke out and we worked with different individual students.","And this was something that in the end she really enjoyed because we started out together, we shared a common interest among the student and family and then were able to",9,5.1
"09_segment-07","um I moved back to the North East about uh four or five years ago. And in doing that ended up having to make a career change. And so uh while I was","dealing with at that point um a lot of different issues, especially coming to uh a situation where I had been a leader or in management in school","organizations. Then coming into another organization where I was um sort of the employee, I did not have any sort of, shall we say Ranking as um a","manager. And um I had one colleague with which, with whom I was working and um it was a very difficult situation all the way round. uh This person was","very strong headed, uh very intimidating and at first I let that uh take me, I kind of fell under that. um Because I was beginning to feel very","insecure in my abilities on what I was doing. And so whatever this person had said is something that I had believed. um It really was uh a learning","experience for me even at a later age where I had had so much work experience before it just taught me that there's always, you're always in a learning","process. um Our interactions were um mostly professional, there were times that there was gossip being spread um and blame was being placed. And","therefore became more of a he said, she said situation. So it ended up not being the most pleasant of work environment for either one of us. um But we","were able to accomplish the work that we needed to get done. We ended up completing everything that, as I said, that needed to be finished um but yet",9,4.2
"09_segment-08","uh Moving into this new work environment um brought about many different changes in the type of work that I was doing. And so um going as I say from a managerial role","down to the employee role and working on just specific tasks. There were times I found it that I was just doing the same thing over and over and over and over. um But","also had been given more on my plate than other colleagues. And um it certainly was something that sort of weighed heavy on me and I was not um at this point sure","really what to do. So um what I would have thought I would have expected from my employees, what they would come and speak with me as the director manager. So that's","exactly what I did at this point in time, I felt that I was putting in a lot of work. um I was doing the same kind of tasks, I was working on weekend and I know that","others were not. I had many more different um program titles on my plate than others. So I went to my manager to discus the situation and just to kind of ask questions","about why this was happening, why I was given this specific task? Why was I being stretched further than others? um Was it because I came in at a different level than","some other new hires? um So it was usually very interesting to me that um something like this was happening. And so I then as I said spoke with the manager and um","through our discussions I accepted what was given as an answer. um I cannot say that I fully agreed with it but it was a new situation, it was a new working","environment, I was still learning the climate of what the um working environment was calling for. So it was not, um I would say resolved the way I wanted but I did",9,4.8
"09_segment-09","Um for the situation here [one of], a colleague was given the role to uh be the leader of a group project that we were working on. And there were about four of us that were part","of the group and all of us had the content knowledge that was required for this project. The leader basically just walked in, took control and for the three of us did not pay","much attention to what we were saying um and actually did ignore what our suggestions were. So uh it got to a point where most of the meeting that we had were fruitless, I mean","there was no reason to go. We weren't really getting anything done that we wanted or we felt was important. And um I just did not think that this person was the right person for","the position. So I tried to speak with the person individually and see where they were coming from, to try to understand why they were doing or managing the group the way they","were managing it. Uh because I thought there could have been some other skills used that would have been more profitable and more encouraging and motivating to the others. The","person did not really pay much attention, uh face to face it was fine but when we got back into the group setting the person fell back into the same old routine. Uh I then uh","went to speak to the managers about this, uh felt that they also did not do much uh to help uh resolve the issue and then moved up to the senior director kind of following the","protocol that's necessary. Uh it was an important project but it was usually only the voice of one person. And if the three others, if we were going to be putting our names to","this uh there needed to be a time where we would be heard and our contributions would have been accepted. So the uh senior director did step in and there was a replacement for",9,5.7
"09_segment-10","uh Coming to consensus on a uh decision is extremely difficult at times, um in particularly dealing with uh certain people. Or uh with a","dynamic of the group. um And in this one particular case we were trying to come up with um ideas on how to uh revise specific um materials","that we wanted to be using in uh some of our test development. So the uh, I found that after we met as a group we had discussed um and voiced","our opinions. um One of the best ways for us to overcome this idea of everyone not really communicating well, that people really weren't","listening. That it was best to um kind of take a little bit of a lead and just give each person the amount, quiet time, specific time so that","we all could listen to each other, rather than talk over each other. I think that, uh my personal opinion is that some people have a very","difficult time listening. They'd rather just go in, take the lead, move forward uh but not actually listen to others. And by sitting back and","by listening I think there's a great way that you are able to um gain more understanding of what is, uh someone else of course is thinking.","What their ideas might be. um And so in this case uh after we were able to separate our selves, listen to what each one had to say, work","together then discuss as a group. We were able then to come up with materials that we felt were certainly test worthy of high quality and um",9,5.7
"09_segment-11","In working on the projects that I have presently right now, uh one in particular has specific test specs that we have to follow with a very strong","blueprint. And uh this is a current situation that we're going through where uh we're asked to be aligned. That there are several content uh areas that","are asked to be aligned across our curriculum and our exam. And uh one of my colleagues in the, one of the other content areas uh is not particularly","following the blueprint the way that it should be done. And that is causing some very difficulty issues among interior, among the other colleagues and","myself. As well as we need to be careful then how this is communicated to the client. Uh And so this has been going on and my colleagues who's not","following the blueprint is working with a second colleague. The second colleague is trying to uh get her colleague back on focus and their communication","and his treatment of her has not been the uh most professional. And at times to be very honest it is sort of uh rather negative. And uh I felt that this","was something I had a hard time seeing and a hard time watching. I had encouraged the female colleague to go ahead and speak with managers, to share how","she was feeling and what was going on. Uh But it was still something that was gnawing at me as I made an appointment to speak with the managers myself. As","I was there uh observing all of this and seeing how this was happening and seeing what was going on. So although it was very difficult I thought it was",9,5.1
"09_segment-12","Uh I work on a program in AP, Advanced Placement. And in our first face to face committee meeting uh in the fall following the exams in May. We have to give the","committee uh a review of the statistics of how each section of the exam performed. Um and this is something that is extremely challenging because uh understanding","test specs and test stats uh is not easy. What we have decided and my colleague and I when we looked at this and um our decision was the best way probably to","present the material so that the test development committee would understand its relevance and its importance was to work through graphs and charts. Was to take the","numbers and instead of just presenting list of numbers and talking about uh what each one means, it was to show it graphically. That way then they were really able","to see for example um what the mean score was, where did it fall on this graph? uh what were some of the easier questions, what were some of the harder questions,","what test type was more difficult than others. Um I think using [the], as I said sort of the pictures, the graphs, the charts. It made the information uh much more","um acceptable and understandable to them. So that when we start working on developing future exams and future items and future uh questions. We can then go back,","review what we have seen and then start making decisions on how do we change specific things to make them more difficult or more easy or which task type needs to be","amped a little bit up or needs to be lowered. So uh taking statistics and putting them into graphs and pictures uh certainly made our committee understand more what",9,5.5
"11_segment-01","I think that one of the, most current examples that I could use for this is when I was working on the TExES Theater exam as the","lead admin. I was charged with procurements, which meant that I had to identify and recruit potential outside item writers for the","TExES theater exam. To start with this I was working with two assessment specialists and after our initial meeting where they","discussed what they were looking for, neither of them had ever worked with improvement before and that is something that I","specialize in. So I was able to really take charge of that aspect of it. When I started I looked at the search parameters that had","come up during discussion and I found a website that specialized in uh TExES educator theater awards. And I thought it would also","be more qualified to writing up theater event past awards with mumble. With that I was able to get contact information and I","launched them to a sales pitch pitch that I had previously run by the assessment specialists for approval and I recruited them,","thankfully I was able to recruit a number of outside item writers, I want to see around thirty-five or so.

Unfortunately my tenure as an apartment assistant coincided with Hurricane Sandy. So in terms of","building motivation the first thing that comes to my mind is when myself and a number of my fellow staff members were actually transported to the bush uh campus center where we slept on the","floor for a number of days with a number of our residents. These were residents that were mostly international or out of state students that had not been able to evacuate campus and find","shelter nearby. And it was particularly frustrating for some of my staff members and myself since we lived close by, but due to our work we weren't allowed to go home because we have to be","there to serve as a resource for the students. So I decided to play games and [I also], this coincided right around Halloween and I have a stockpile of candy and so I'd go around to my","essentially when I saw that there is high or you know possibly starting to be a little bit cranky and I would shower them with candy since that would boost their sugar levels up.

IU Power was supposed to pilot and it did pilot uh being a big presence for labor studies students to go out, network and also work on the","skills that we were building in the classroom. Since we were founding the club all of the members were incredibly passionate about the direction that the club","should go in, how to go about with the formation.

Zack and Cody were very","passionate about the club but had very different ideas with the direction in which it should go and this difference caused them to clash multiple times. The way","that I ended up resolving that as the vice president of that club was to assign then to the same task.

"11_segment-06","When I first started working at ETS I was tasked with mostly data entry and the software such as TCFs and what is now IBIS.

Uh I track the data associated with test items from treatments, to","passage to unit development and form completion. The way that I got that or I got tasked with that unfortunately is actually a very funny story. There was a meeting that took place","within the first few days of my hire, uh at the time and uh during that meeting some assessment specialists where vocalizing their frustration of the current way that the data was","being captured especially since each of them were capturing the data separately. And there was sometimes miscommunication or just lack of communication in terms of where each item","was in development and also they were using different tracking mechanism some of them kept track of it strictly via email, others use Excel, others use static word documents. And I","had an idea at the start of the meeting of a way to synthesize that information and to make everyone's lives a lot easier, but I chose not to speak at that moment, what I did was","after the meeting, I went to each of the specialists individually and I asked them look at what data they had so far. They were all very willing to give it to me and so what I did","is I went and on my own created a mechanism to capture all of the data and record it and then also implement formulas, conditional formatting and various linked cells, to sort of","alternate uh data entry and automate that capture. And then at our next meeting I presented what I created and asked if they approved of it, so that we could then start to use it",11,5.9
"11_segment-07","At a former job I was tasked with being in charge of this project and I was put on this project with a team of people including a co-worker who had a very","different work style than I did and he and I had previously had uh discussions about these differences. As the team leader I took responsibility of talking to him","outside of the meeting, outside of any, our work with our other co-workers in addressing the fact that I would allow him to work the way that he thought was the","most productive, if he would be more open to constructive criticism in terms of the end results. I like to let people work the way that they work best, I feel as","if one of the biggest hampers to productivity is to micro manage. I also believe in learning from differences that people have because, as my parents like to","remind me, there is more than one way to skin a cat and somebody always knows something that you don't know. So at the end of the project I was very pleased with","his approach, I was very pleased with the way that we had worked all together, he I guess was very happy that I had spoken to him [that's why], because he kept me","in the loop the entire time, every week I would get a status update as to where he was with the project. And he ended up converting me into his way of doing","things, because that result was just fantastic. And so I learned that open communication and trust is really what's necessary when you're working with someone that","you do not necessarily get along with or you have a difference of opinion on in terms of how to get things done. It's not about how it gets done it's the fact that",11,6.5
"11_segment-08","If I were to rank what my favorite on the job activities were filing and data entry would not rank anywhere near the top ten.","However, filing and data entry are some of the most important aspects of any job and so many of the jobs that I've been to, coming","in as the lowest trained member, I have had to do my fair share of filing and data entry. My approach to these is that, if you're","going to do anything, you should do it well, I truly believe in taking ownership of your work no matter what that work is, and","proving yourself through your abilities. So every time that I have been assigned a task that I find distasteful, I just see it as a","challenge in terms of proving my abilities to my co-workers and my superiors in terms of, if I have to file five hundred reports I","am going to make sure that they are filed precisely and quickly. If I have to enter twelve items or units I will make sure that","they're entered as accurately as possible. This is just one more way and one more challenge in terms of proving your worth to your","co-workers and your company. And so  I don't really, I don't back down when I'm given tedious or boring or even physically demanding","tasks because I feel as if, If you understand you have a job, there is no job that's too small and you just have to do what you have",11,6.4
"11_segment-09","At one of my previous jobs there was this project that I think about a lot. I was put on a team with a couple of other co-workers and one of the workers","was actually the lead on the project, and we were charged with creating a deliverable to the client. The lead decided that the project would be done in a","certain way and presented in a format that I disagreed with. And so in the interest of not causing disharmony within the group, I didn't bring up my","objections at a group level, but I instead went to talk to him separately outside of the group. I outlined exactly what my misgivings were and what I","thought alternatives should be, where he so inclined. I will give him credit that he listened to me and he definitely made me feel heard, but ultimately","chose to go in the direction that he planned, unfortunately the clients was not amenable to what we eventually presented to them and instead requested","that it be in the format that I originally decided. Thankfully we were given the project again and this time we were able to present it in that format and","maintain a relationship with that client. What I learned from that is that it is important to voice your opinion, but you have to remember that when you","are not in a leadership position and when someone else is you have to respect their authority and not try and undermine them in any way. If they have","chosen to do something a certain way and you are a member, it is your duty to make sure that it is just done in the best way that you know how even if",11,4.7
"11_segment-10","A few years ago I had an issue with a co-worker who I felt was Just not really listening to any of the directives that I gave her or who, there was just something wrong with the way","that we were communicating with each other, where I didn't sufficiently understood and I later learned that she just felt as if she wasn't being heard. And the way that I resolved","that is really just using active listening skills it wasn't enough for me to simply hear her, I had  to show her that she had been heard. And what that involved is when she told me","something instead of having a response right away, you know sort of being quiet and really taking my time to visibly absorb the information because when someone tells you something","and you have a response right away it can give the impression that you may not have thought through what they said and sometimes that just five second lag where they can see visibly","the process, it  can mean a world of difference in terms of how they feel that you've resolved that information or received that information. So that was sort of the things that I","did. Another thing I did is again something that I learned at one of my previous job experiences which is mirroring. So while she was talking to me and explaining what her","frustrations with the project were, I would say things like I see what you're saying or I agree with you, I would also mirror her posture a little bit and if I felt she was getting","exasperated I would let that show in my face like yes this is really a big problem. And all of that worked together to really just make her feel as if her frustrations were being","heard, she was being taken seriously, her contributions mattered. And sometimes that's really all that needs to happen, it's not enough to simply hear people you have to make sure",11,6.3
"11_segment-11","At one of my previous jobs where I was the executive assistant to the senior loss prevention manager, she had gone on vacation for two weeks and tasked me with corresponding with","different store managers in terms of security installations and other security uh related items. One of the items and she told me that this was a really big priority to get done","while she was gone, was managing the files and also making sure that they were following procedures, uh so that excessive uh police calls or um and sort of triggering a phone line","wouldn't happen. Because the way that it works, when you have a store in a city, there is a city mumble and there is a fine every time you go over like five false police alarms a","moth or a year, I can't remember what the designation was. And this store was exceeding that designation uh grossly and so it was my job to communicate with the store manager to","sort of identify why and make sure that they were following our pre-established policy and procedures regarding the installation and activation of these alarms. While she was out","I did initiate conversation with them, uh however they were very slow to get back to me and actually two days before she came back from vacation, they had triggered another false","alarm which then carried I think a fine of two hundred dollars which as the headquarters we have to pay out to them to then pay to the local uh governing body. And that was the","news that I have to communicate to my manager as soon as she got back from vacation and so the way that I did it is, as soon as she came in, I let her settle in, we made small","talk about how the vacation was and then at the top of my priority list in terms of letting her know events that occurred while she was gone, that was the first thing that I",11,4.9
"11_segment-12","As I previously mentioned and my resume reflects one of my areas of specialty is with Excel and I find Excel really intuitive, I","absolutely adore working with that program but not everyone does.

And the way that I approached this is to actually make very common uh similarities,","the way that I used the similarities was I compared Excel and the formulas to a type of language and specifically the way that you sort","of conjugate a sentence in the English language, in terms of how you build innovate formula for example. And by breaking it down to the","smallest form and just showing, okay so this is similar to this, like this serves as a connector to that, I was able, or I hope that I","was able to make the previously unfamiliar and highly technical material familiar and less technical to what was a very unfamiliar","audience.

"12_segment-01","So several months ago, I knew that for this one major project that I have been assigned to, we had to do a series of cog-webs leading up to a","major client meeting that we had in May. So it got to the point where we were informed that we had these upcoming duties probably back around","January and between January and May we had to do two series of cog-webs and then analyze all the data. And so we did the first series and then","finished up all that work. But then we had the second series to which we had maybe a month before the major client meeting to complete the","second series of cog-webs. So when I was in that situation, I pretty much took it upon myself, I was rather assertive in terms of preparing all","the materials the IRB, all of the regulatory documents. Then in addition to that, I stepped up and I was also very assertive even though I was","not technically a leader, I was still very assertive with making sure that our documents received approval as soon as possible and I took a","proactive role which scheduling participants for conducting these cog-webs. So in that situation, I definitely assumed a leadership role even","though I technically was not a formal leader and because of that we had a positive outcome. We were able to reach our goal of conducting twenty","cog-webs within that aggressive time-frame.

"12_segment-02","So a colleague and I received notice that North Eastern Educational Research Association released its call for proposals and that we were","able if we had any content that we were willing to work on and that we would be able to submit our proposals. In order to be a part of","that conference and in order to speak at that conference. So this one colleague of mine, he and I do a lot of work as lateral colleagues","on the same major federal project. But because this project has a lot of NDA requirements he was not in a position where he was able to","cement a proposal based on that project. And I know one day he talked to me really upset or at least he looked really upset saying, oh","well I won't be able to attend here because I don't have any information I can work with, that I can develop a proposal out of. So I","actually oriented him to a different project sent over some data to him ripped on the background of that project and helped guide him into","reading a proposal, to which he definitely went ahead, accepted the challenge and he seemed really motivated to submit a final product to","nearer our baseline content that he never had any exposure to. Luckily he was able to pull it off and he will be presenting at this","upcoming conference. So I think that definitely gave him some motivation to work on an extra project that otherwise he will not be in a",12,5.8
"12_segment-03","So I used to work at a psychiatric hospital and a lot of my colleagues didn't get along too well with my","supervisor. So I would always try to be the mediator, I would understand what would make both my supervisors as","well as my colleagues tick. There were a lot of situations where I did not like being in the middle but I felt","like I was placed in the middle. But with that being said, I tried to be an effective listener on both parties.","And I tried to do what I could to take away some strain from my supervisor as well as my former colleagues. So","if they were in a situation where they didn't feel comfortable discussing something with my former supervisor,","I would go ahead and actually help them re-word what they are trying to say, to try to help them communicate","more effectively their needs. And the outcome of this was luckily things worked out for the most part. I could","definitely see that uh with these efforts, it seemed like some of the tensions among my colleagues at the psych","hospital seemed to temper off a little bit, and because of that of course we all definitely worked more",12,5.7
"12_segment-04","So my previous job this was a big part of my previous position. I was an allied therapist at a psychiatric hospital. And trying to gain the trust of my former clients was always an","angling goal because if we cannot get any full disclosure of them, then we cannot address any underlying issues that they are experiencing. So in order to help them recover, we had","to try to develop a trusting rapport with them and in addition to that we also tried negotiating with them. One big part of that, of course in order to gain trust of my former","clients, I would always treat them in a very respectful manner, and I would frequently try to go out of my way be very friendly to them. But also in terms of negotiating, I would","always try be really transparent with them and sometimes they would make requests beyond me to which I would communicate assertively. I don't know if I can actually do that but","instead how about if I see if I could handle this for you instead. Because sometimes their request weren't always within the confines of my position but in that situation I would","definitely be honest with them and I'd definitely tell them that I would try to help them get whatever they want.

But [I","would definitely] in those situations, I would never promise something that I would not be able to keep but I would let them know that I'll try, I'll advocate for them and that","I'll do what I can whatever is possible. I think that was very effective because in that situation I did not let down my clients, they did not tend to get aggressive with me","because I never actually promised anything that I could not deliver. I think they say that as an honest effort to try to work with them, to try to negotiate, to try and meet their",12,5.8
"12_segment-05","So when I was working on my masters degree, some curve balls were thrown at me that through the department agreed to certain things that","unfortunately I guess he was at a position to fully execute. So I signed up into that program thinking that I would actually graduate in a","year. And there were times where with this I had to compromise because an issue popped up with my funding [where he told me] I was originally","supposed to go to school from August until the next following summer. Then I would technically graduate in the following August and he told","me shortly before the spring semester ended that he cannot secure funding for me to go class through out the summer. Then I had to wait until","the fall. So that was definitely something that I had to make compromises on and that situation [there wasn't], I definitely did have","alternative options. I could have dropped out, I could have gotten angry with him, but instead I just accepted it as a situation beyond our","control. And to be honest I could only complain so much about the matter because I got a really nice funding package. So ultimately I ended","up having to have my graduation postponed and instead of graduating on August, I had to graduate in September, I'm sorry in December. But I","believe that because of that, my thesis ended up being stronger because I got to spend more time reading it. So I would say it brought about",12,3.3
"12_segment-06","So for my masters thesis I had to be very assertive about the topic I wanted to write about.","The way how most of the students that were also on the program with me for the most part, most","of them actually chose topics for their thesis that were either continuation of prior thesis","that other students had ran or continuation of a professor's work. Whereas my interests were a","little bit different from the program, so in order to move forward with this, my prognosis","chronology program and I wanted to do something that had a little more of a forensic","psychology basis. So I had to propose my idea of course to my thesis committee but prior to","doing so, I spoke to a couple of people outside of the department as well as people that were","inside the department but not part of the graduate program. I got some prospective from them.","And I think they definitely helped me draft a stronger oral thesis proposal that I was able to",12,4.4
"12_segment-07","So in the past I had to work with an individual who would have impulsive flashes of aggression and that made it","particularly challenging for someone like me to work with him because I find that behavior to be very distracting.","So ultimately because I could not go on and be productive while feeling very negative about the situation, I","decided to make a little bit of a joke out of it. I started to keep a log of all the insults that this individual","said and I would just later on look at it and chuckle about it. Have a nice laugh and just accept that that's the","way how this individual interacts and with other people sometimes and that there is nothing I can do about it","expect try to have a good humor about it. So and ultimately I felt a lot less stressed out after i decided to take","a slightly more humorous approach to it, and because of that I feel like my productivity increased from the","situation. And on the other side I doubt that the individual really maybe he noticed I really cannot speak for the","individual, but I think overall the outcome was positive because I was able to feel like ultimately I ended up",12,3.2
"12_segment-08","To be honest I've been lucky because all the work environments I've ever been in, had pretty solid division of labor and in all those situations my","employees were always my co-workers rather were always willing to work together to try and make that sure that everyone gets their fair share. But I can","say that some tasks that I worked on had a massive volume of tasks that were not necessarily the most exciting tasks. Again that was pretty well split","evenly. And in that situation I definitely made sure to just put my nose down, get the task done and try to do it to the best of my ability of course. I","think one strategy in general that's really effective in terms of sharing unpleasant tasks, I feel like because I'm the type of person to check in on my","co-workers and to ask if they need any help or if they need anything. I feel like because I put myself out there and offer them assistance and that I","offer to pick up a little task from them, I feel like I personally don't end up in that situation too much. I feel like things bounce on that because I'm","willing to take on dual tasks. I feel like they are willing to give me a certain consideration and I feel like they tend to step in a lot. If I'm in a","situation where they know that I have dual tasks. So and I can say ultimately that the outcomes ends up being favorable because the task is done. And and","I can definitely say that all my colleagues work very hard so in that situation I know more often than not they don't think twice about picking up their",12,5.8
"12_segment-09","So I'm very lucky to say that I've never actually been in this position, and if I were in this position","however to be honest, I think that how I would handle the situation it will depend on the group dynamics.","First and foremost, if I'm in a position where I can speak to a superior and where I feel comfortable","speaking to a superior, I think that would probably be an appropriate approach. So that or alternatively","if I could speak to the person that took leadership of the group project and have a level of rapport with","them, I think in that situation I would to try to inform him or her of their behavior because there's","always a possibility that if somebody is taking leadership of a project and blatantly disregarding","contributions that are inconsistent because of her opinion, there's always a possibility that they are","not aware of it. So I think it will be important to make sure that he or she is aware of it before I end","up making a large issue out of it and before anyone ends up getting in trouble or reprimanded or before",12,5.1
"12_segment-10","So this was a consistent challenge as you can imagine where I used to work at a psychiatric hospital. My former clients would would frequently get into","arguments, abuse each other. So when one of my mutual roles of course was to keep everyone safe and to try to discourage fighting, to try to prevent things","from escalating. So with that being said, I would frequently have to listen to my clients when they would have an issue, when they would start to express","naive emotions. I'd have to listen to them actively and a lot of times I engaged in the behavior of reflective listening which was when I basically repeated","what they said but paraphrased it to make sure that I'm understanding exactly what they are saying. That was a big part of how my former clients and I would","work together to try to resolve communication issues. A lot of times I would actually, if they, I would also help work with them to develop a plan for how","to effectively communicate maybe something that they want to get across. Sometimes I would listen to their needs and write down a course of action to help","them get their point across or to help them handle an issue. So and unusually I found especially that with active listening, things were usually pretty","effective because everyone likes to know that you are actually listening to them when they are speaking. And on top of that reflective listening, sometimes","through reflective listening I felt like my former clients at least they expressed moments of insight where, oh yeah I understand why that person got really",12,6.5
"12_segment-11","So in the past when I had to communicate difficult or critical feedback to my supervisor, I would go about it a couple of different ways, it","really depended on the situation to be honest. If it's something extremely time sensitive that required an urgent response, I would typically","either try to reach her on the cell phone or text her. If it's something that was a little bit complicated however, something that requires a","lot more content to be absorbed, I would usually request that she and I could meet briefly, so I'll be able to explain whatever it is that I","would have to tell her. And sometimes one method that I use a lot is if I have something extremely complicated that I need to communicate, or","if there is a couple of points that I need to share with her, I'll write it down in an organized manner so that I don't forget anything, and","so that I can cover every topic and every relevant point in a logical manner. I found that this has been very effective. And sometimes too if","something is not particularly time sensitive, but if it's critical enough, sometimes I'll send it over email so that there is documentation","that I did communicate whatever issue it was for. Typically in the most pressing situations I would actually email her, request a meeting and","then go from there, meet up with her and discuss with her whatever the issue is that needs to be discussed. The difficult information critical",12,4.6
"12_segment-12","So in the past when I worked as an allied therapist at a psychiatric hospital, I would conduct psycho educational groups and a lot of times, a lot of the content that","I spoke about of course could get pretty typical, a lot of terminology might not be familiar to my audience. Of course my audience was mumble, they were always","changing. We would have new clients coming in and out on a regular basis. So [usually for my groups] of course I tailored it, we had one unit that was our acute unit,","which they tended to not be in a position to understand more complex information. And then we had our other unit which had people that were more civilized. So I would","actually tailor my groups for the groups that were on the acute unit, I would try to make my groups a lot more hands-on and I would move my language try use more","familiar terminology to them whenever I would do a group let's say anger management or when I would do a group on uh taking care of yourself. So and another way that","I like to express this and educate my um former clients is that on both the ends actually, I would use a chalk board or a white board a lot of times and try to drill","out the different points that I'm talking about. Sometimes also, for example I used to do a group on communication styles. We would discuss active, aggressive and","passive aggressive communication. And for those groups I would actually have my former clients act out the different communication styles. So I alternately tried to","keep things interactive enough where they were engaged and I tried to break down information in a way that they would understand and it seems like the outcomes were",12,5.9
"14_segment-01","There was a very large mailing coming up and the","person who was in charge of it was moving very slowly,","and I felt that they weren't getting things done","quickly enough.

As a","result the mailing did go out in time, everything was","very highly organized and we were successful. The","person who was in charge thanked me for taking the",14,4.2
"14_segment-02","We had a huge new job coming up and we were already overwhelmed with work. So we were in a staff","meeting talking about it and trying to decide how we were going to get it done. And people were saying","we can't do this, there's not enough people, we have too much work already, and I said to them all, We","can do this. We're a team, this is what we do. If we all pull together we can do this. We  might have","to work extra. We might have to put in more time but we're a good team and we can get this done. And","we did get it done. um Everything went well. We were a little crazy for a while but the job was done.","It was done well, nothing else crashed while we were trying to complete this one. everybody carried","out all of their daily responsibilities but we did get it done, it was good.

And while I was the team lead","there were other people that were the leads under me in different areas. uh These two young girls decided that this one older,","older lady didn't know what she was doing and they were giving her a really hard time. um And this older lady was very","conscientious and had been doing this for quite a while and I thought that she did know what she was doing. So I took these","two girls aside and I tried to talk to them but they were young and very belligerent and showed that they were right and she","was wrong and the two of them were not good together. So what I did was moved one of them to another group, and put the one","who was the least contentious back where she was. uh Without her friend there to go with her along she did very well in that","group after that. um The other girl was angry, uh I believed that she quit because she was mad that she was separated from her","friend. um I didn't feel that that was a huge loss because she was a troublemaker.

"14_segment-04","Okay I'm going to have to go back to the same two girls. um Again they were causing trouble in the area","where work needed to be done. um I tried to explain to them that this is how it had to be. I tried to","get them to change their behavior and have, show some respect for the person that they were reporting","directly to. um And then as I said before I separated them. I tried to get them to know that I was","trying to look out for them as well as the lady that they were giving a hard time to, and the job that","had to be done. They felt that, you know they were younger than me, they knew more than me. I tried to","get them to understand that I had been doing this for quite a little while and knew what I was talking","about. The one absolutely did not believe me, the other one was very willing to work with me. And as a","result the job got done. The lady in question was happy with the outcome.

"14_segment-05","Well, as I'm sure you know there are always times when you have to compromise. When you're in a meeting and you have","one idea of how something should be run and somebody else has another idea and and you're so sure you're right but","they're so sure they're right also, there has to be some kind of compromise. um I've been in meetings where I felt","that a job should be done the way that I wanted you to do it and somebody else thought that we should get rid of","certain things um and only use technology.

"14_segment-07","I had to work in an office with a woman who was pretty cold. Um she kind of went out of her way to snipe","with people all the time. I tried to maintain my professionalism. I was very polite to her, in fact I was","friendly to her when the opportunity presented itself. Um as it turned out she had no ammunition and she","pretty much just didn't even speak to me when I passed her. However every time I passed her I'd bless her","because that made it easier for me to be kind to her. Uh eventually I moved out of that office. She is","still in my area, um not in my work area but she's on the same floor as me. I pass through the hall","everyday, I say hello to her everyday. She says hello back to me. I'm glad I don't have to work with her","anymore, um I still try to bless her. But I think it worked out fairly well. Nobody was ever hurt and","there was never a quarrel or any unprofessional behavior. So I guess that's all you can do when","somebody's not likable, is just be professional and be as kind as you can and be nice to them when you",14,4.9
"14_segment-08","I worked in a office with a boss who was very charming with people. I was not one of her favorites, she liked the people","that came to her with gossip and shared gossip and I didn't do that. um They were handing out jobs one time for a giant","thing that we had to do every summer and when I looked at my job list I had fifteen programs. Some people had four, some","people had five, I had fifteen. um One of them involved working every weekend, uh a couple of them were huge, a couple of","them were small. I looked at the list and I raised my eyebrows and I didn't say a word to anybody about it. I just went","back to my office and took care of business, um that's all you can do. She was waiting for me to fail and I didn't fail,","everything worked out just fine. um The next year I got a reasonable amount of programs but she was surprised that I was","able to carry that off. I did have to work extra hard at it, uh I did have to put in some overtime, lots of overtime. But","the jobs were all done. Everything worked out just fine and as a result I think that she had a little bit more respect for","me. I on the other hand, I know I shouldn't say this, but I didn't have any respect fir her at all. uh She is no longer",14,5.2
"14_segment-09","We were at a really large work conference, um the person in charge was kind of a control","freak. um No matter what anybody deed they didn't get credit for it, it didn't count. It all","had to be her way or no way.um Personally I think that the person in charge is the person in","charge and you need to respect that person's position. And so I just did what I could do to","help out, umdidn't say anything about it. Told myself not to expect any praise or reward for","it, and I was good with that. um um Things just worked out. I mean the person in charge knew","what she was doing, she just would not accept any advice from anyone else, and we were all","pretty experienced. But as the person in charge I felt that you have to respect that person's","title. And so I did things her way,um did what I could do on the side to make things easier","for her, and that's it. I mean it all worked out. It always does, and then you walk away and",14,2.1
"14_segment-10","Okay, I have to admit here that I do not have great listening skills. If I can't see the person who's","talking and look at them while they're talking my mind tends to wonder. So when there's like a, a","conference of, on the Internet, a phone conference, I take copious notes uh because that keeps my mind","from wondering away from the conversation at hand. uh That's pretty much what I do. I've had phone","conferences with my boss, with the college board, uh with program directionals, and usually I end up","with something with a work topic, something to do, uh or they'll ask me questions. Taking notes is what","works for me, so I take notes and then after the meeting's over I put the notes into some kind of","format and keep them and then I know what's expected of me and I know what's expected of everybody else","and what the meeting was trying to take care of. So that's my, that's my way of coping with my","listening problem, is to take notes because if you're busy writing down the questions then you really",14,4.2
"14_segment-11","Okay I'm going to tell you about the difficult information portion of this question because it's difficult to tell your","boss when something went wrong. Uh What I usually do or what I have done in the past is I look at what went wrong and","then I try to find history of how it led up to this. I generally do a work document that lists uh the start, all the","details in between, and what happened at the end. And then I try to conclude with how this could have happened and how","it could have been prevented. I then go to my boss, uh I make sure he has a copy, I have a copy, and then I give him","the bad news. He always asks me how it happened, what we could have done to prevent it, and I have this all outlined","for him so it's easy for him to see the entire thread. He seems to appreciate that, and then he generally tells me to","fix it. Sometimes I can't fix it, sometimes he has to intervene to fix it. Uh when I can I do, when I can't I work with","him to take care of the problem. This has worked out for both of us very well. It doesn't happen often but when it does","happen it's nice to have some type of format to follow. And it is always hard to give your boss bad information or bad",14,6
"14_segment-12","Well here at ETS we have to write out SOPs for everything that we do. Uh some of my jobs are very labor intensive, uh lots and lots of","steps. And I found that first I write out an outline numbering the steps that have to be taken and then I do it down further and explain","the steps. I always use layman's terms when explaining to people. I do put the proper terms in parentheses so that they'll know what they","are but at the same time they can read the outline without feeling confused or lost. Uh after the outline is completed then I do a","flowchart so they can just follow the flowchart. Generally we meet about this, we go over it. They will read through and anything that","they don't understand they will ask me and I will make corrections to make it easier for them to understand. After they've gone through","it a few times and understand everything then that will be the final draft. And then they have a copy, I have a copy, we all know steps","we're supposed to follow. Everybody knows what the terminology is and it makes the work go very smoothly. Uh new people coming in need to","have these charts, these flowcharts and these SOPs so that they can do the job if they need to. And as my backup was very inexperienced","with my job when I was out of work for a little while, she was able to follow the charts and take care of business. So the outcome was",14,6
"15_segment-01","uh So the background situation was I was at my first uh summer job. I was a customer service representative. uh I","specifically had the roles of answering questions regarding the EP Testing Program, so often times parents would call","asking for their children's scores, or other people would call uh saying that they want to send out the scores to different","colleges and what not. And so I was hired as, just as general worker. I wasn't really supposed to be a leader of any sorts,","but um essentially what I tried to do was try to be the most efficient employee there. So at the end of the day I would","always have the number one score for most calls handled properly, and I was actually nearing in numbers as the same regular","employees as opposed to just temporary workers. So eventually my mangers took notice that I was actually answering everyday","cost the amount of calls so they started talking to me more and uh basically I got really friendly with all my managers. uh","They would often stop by in my cubicle to ask how I was doing and, and what not. If I had any downtime we would just chat","about, you know different, not necessarily work related subjects. But overall we got along very well and they definitely",15,3.4
"15_segment-02","So in high school I was hired as a lab assistant, so basically the details of the job was just to assist the","graduate students in anything that they needed around the lab. So most of our responsibilities were very dull,","we would be mashing up food and putting it on a petri dish to see what grows on it. And uh basically I had a","few other coworkers and it was really dull work so usually everybody was pretty lackadaisical about it. So in","order to spice things up a bit at one point me and a fellow coworker got in a competition to see how many","petri dishes we could fill up and who could do it the fastest. So for a few days in a row we were just doing","as many petri dishes as possible and we finished all the work we had for that week extremely early because we","just got into this ridiculous competition as to who could fill up the most petri dishes and properly [spin","the], to collect the uh food and the bacteria on it. So basically we just got all of our work done really","quickly. And since we had to work for the whole day anyways, we had a ton of extra downtime because there was",15,4.1
"15_segment-03","So at the call center uh during the first two weeks of training I made a few very good friends and we would always hang out together","when we weren't in call. And there was this other girl that also worked there who suffice to say was not exactly the most amicable","person. uh She had many endogenous characteristics such as the ability to grow enmity beyond the most of us, and a few of the members","in our group didn't really like her that much and you know she wasn't exactly the best worker either considering that she would yell at","some of the people who called us at customer service which is completely unacceptable. So basically we had no way of properly fixing","her technique of speaking to the customers because she was overall kind of rude and that's not good. But basically the entire group","expressed our concern to our managers and basically they sat her down and talked to her and said that, You know you cannot treat the","people who call us so purely. You have to actually maintain some sort of professionalism and you know keep your cool and answer their","questions and help them as much as you can instead of just yelling at them and calling them names and you know, being an unfriendly","person. So just through our general disapproval, it was kind of noticed by our managers and I'm sure that they already noticed",15,2
"15_segment-04","So at the call center uh the standard work day was eight hours, but you had opportunities for","overtime if the, if there was a high volume of calls. So some of the workers wanted to always go","home early and just leave as soon as possible. But uh me and a few other coworkers always really","wanted to get the extra overTime because overtime pays really nice. So basically on the days where","there were too many workers and not enough calls, the managers would be forced to send some people","home. So sometimes we would talk to each other it'd be like oh, you know, do you have anything to","do later? Are you busy? Like maybe you should just go home instead that kind of thing. But usually","it ended up being up to our mangers and the way they picked who would stay later would be drawing","names from a hat. So if you wanted to stay later you would just throw your name into a hat and if","they picked your name then, then you had to go home. So it was at the end solved in a very fair",15,2.6
"15_segment-05","So at the lab that I worked at, it was a food science lab. So basically we had to grow","bacteria on different samples of food based petri dishes. And uh one of the jobs was after we","finished growing the bacteria on a petri dish, you had to count the number of spore colonies","on it. So this was extremely frustrating work for me because I just don't want to sit there","and count hundreds of different bacteria colonies because it's extremely frustrating and if","you lose count you have to start all over again. So I compromised with a fellow worker by","asking him to do more of my plates than just his. And in return I would end up washing more","of the lab equipment, so we would have like you know pipettes and uh different lab equipment","that needed to be washed at the end of the day. And I didn't really mind doing this, so we","basically traded responsibilities. So I would just count less of the bacteria and just wash",15,5.5
"15_segment-06","So at the food science lab occasionally we had to go out to the nearby downing holes to pick more samples of food because we","were studying which foods at the dining hall were basically the dirtiest or had the potential to become the most dirty. And so","usually the grad students would start running out of ideas and they would start asking the rest of us, Oh, you know, what do","you think will be the most contaminated at the end of the day? So all of us as students would really just kind of come up with","different ideas as to what would become the most dirty. So my idea was that at the salad bar there was always this chicken and","it was like, it was a pretty cooked chicken. They just spread it, it was a sliced up bread and chicken and so I proposed to","the rest of the team that this had potential to become the most dirty because it was a viable source of protein, oils, and","fats. And it was cooked twice basically and was left sitting at the salad bar because nobody had finished the previous bread","and chicken where it came from. So I essentially convinced everyone else that this chicken was the best bet because everybody","else was essentially just hot food. So we just went with the different picks of the salad bar to try to find out what was the",15,4.7
"15_segment-07","So at the call center, Anna, the girl that I previously mentioned, uh none of our friends really","liked her or anything. I didn't particularly like her, uh mostly because of her professionalism but","at the same time her, um she had a certain odor about her that I didn't mention before and she","actually kind of wreathed when you were near her. So basically we had to keep the same cubicles at","all times, like we weren't allowed to switch cubicles really. So we would only really see her","around lunch time and uh she would, she wouldn't exactly come to our group to try to hang out with","us. She would just sit around our group. So basically we didn't get any of the positive","interactions like you know oh how are you? How is it going or whatever. We would just kind of smile","at her from the lunch group. And uh basically our interaction with her was we try to limit it as","much as possible because she wasn't very conducive to the customers that called and her appearance",15,1.7
"15_segment-08","So at the call center basically all of our tasks were unpleasant because they were all tedious and boring, and I thought I was","being given more than my fair share of the work because I was handling so many more calls without actually even trying to handle a","lot more calls at that point. And so what I did was just try to go through them as quick as possible, but I knew that there was","going to be a never ending stream of calls for the entire day so what I did was actually press the busy button twice in a row","after I finished a call, because the first time you press it you're supposed to fill out all the necessary paperwork that went","with the call. [And then], but I would press it twice and that would send me to the bottom of the call queue. So basically if I","was sitting at the top of the queue to receive the next call then I press that button twice instead of just once then I would be","sent all the way back to the bottom of the queue and everyone else would have to answer the calls before me and that would give me","sufficient time to fill out the rest of the paperwork that I had to do. But now that I think about it, even though I kept getting","sent to the bottom of the queue, the fact that I still handled more than like double of some people's calls, it's still probably",15,2.3
"15_segment-09","So at the fruit science lab there were, uh basically sometimes we would","have group projects to finish and occasionally the grad students were","asking us for different suggestions and inputs. And basically uh whenever","they didn't like anything they won't put it in. And there is honestly not","much we could have done about the situation because their scope of","knowledge was infinitely greater than ours and not only that it was","pretty much their project and that were just going to be helpers and","subordinates to it. So it really started off as kind of group project","amongst the grad students in a normal sense but anything that they","thought wasn't going to be good in it was removed, and we would have",15,1.8
"15_segment-10","So at the call center, essentially the whole job was using listening skills to overcome communication problems. So majority of our","calls were related to a student who did fail to fill out the proper paperwork while taking the exam, just send the scores, his or","her sure, scores to the college of their choice. So often times we would get airy parents calling us saying, Oh how dare you not","send their scores to the college like they need that stuff to, you know, to give the appropriate credits out. So often times we","would just have to sit there and listen to them yell at us continually for having to not done it. and basically we overcome this","problem by saying on every single exam that they were given for the AP test they had an opportunity to fill it out and say I want","these scores sent out to so and so college. And the fact that it wasn't sent out was not actually an error on college boards fault.","It was an error because the student failed to fill it out. And we can see it through all the computer paperwork that we were given","that they actually just failed to send it out. And usually after we finish telling this to the parents they would immediately stop","being angry. They would apologize to us and assure us that their kid was going to be told off for their failure to send their scores",15,4
"15_segment-11","So often times at the call center we would get callers who feel particularly entitled and when they can't get their way they insist on speaking to managers. And so one particular lady comes to mind, this lady","called about um a one year refund for having sent out a score to a college that they don't feel that they should have sent it out to. And so obviously this refund is impossible because they filled out all the","work to send it to that college so why on earth would anybody refund that? So basically this lady calls and she's like I demand like my ten dollar refund for this, and I was like I'm sorry, like that's","impossible. You can't get this refund because you filled out all the necessary paperwork for it and you had it sent it out. So this lady immediately became angry and demanded to speak to my supervisor. And so I","was like all right, well I'm sorry. I'll see if I can get him on the line. And so what actually happens when the call center representative says that I'll try to get my manager is that they are not going to get","the manager because your call is ridiculous and there's just nothing that the manager can do anyways regarding it. So basically I went to my manager and I was like, Hey John, listen there's this crazy lady on","the line, like she's demanding this ten dollar refund. And so he's like uh you know, like nothing you could do about it. Go handle it. So basically I went back to my seat and I said, I'm terribly sorry ma'am","but the manager is extremely busy. We have a very high call volume today. So if you are okay with being put on hold then I'll just keep trying to get the manager. So for the next two hours I basically kept","call, I basically uh you know, talk to her again every fifteen minutes. I was like Listen, the manager is still busy. After two hours of trying to get a ten dollar refund this lady was finally like, Okay I","guess you tried  your best. I'll just call back tomorrow. So basically I was just like, All right, well have a good day, and that was essentially, uh basically trying to communicate with my supervisor about",15,1.9
"15_segment-12","So the most technical problem we usually encounter at the call center was that teachers would call us asking on","how to get the scores of their students. This was a multi step process that involved signing on to the website,","putting in all the necessary information and then go into the right tabs in order to access the proper class to","get the uh scores of the students that they want. So a lot of the teachers have no idea how to use computers in","the first place so basically as representatives we had to walk them through uh every single step of operating a","computer. So basically we were like, okay press the power button, turn on the computer, put in the logging","information to access the computer. Open the Internet, which they had a huge problem with usually because you","know sometimes the Internet's Firefox instead of Internet Explorer and they got really confused. So basically we","have to walk them through every single step, assume that they know absolutely nothing and through doing every","single step and describing every minute detail usually we'll be able to walk them through the necessary steps of",15,3.4
"16_segment-01","That's a good question I think most of my life I try to be a leader and I think sometimes it comes naturally to me. Uh a couple of times in my,","with my recent company, with my previous company excuse me, uh we will join the swine flu scare back in uh I think two-thousand nine I was working","in an ER and every night we would have patients lined up out the door and uh it was a very difficult time for staff members and especially","patients. But uh in order to server the needs of the patients, we would um have to work twice as hard and sometimes stay late, work extra and a lot","of times um staff members got very frustrated. Uh Irritated with each other with the patients and uh when I was there, I had the attitude and","mentality um that whatever had happened, had already happened and in order to get by and get through the night we had to focus on the future, we","had to be patient with ourselves and the clients as well um and I always wanted to tell the staff uh to focus and think about others and uh be kind","and the way you talk to one another, talk to the patients. Uh you know really the minds that we as a team we can get through this uh and really","just focusing, once in a while take a deep breath and I was always there to kind of remind the staff members uh the reason why we were there. And I","think uh a lot of times I was successful in doing that and I also believe that, uh the patients were grateful for the way that we performed in such",16,5
"16_segment-02","Motivation I think is a uh something that I always think about and also positive thinking. I think uh when people are having a bad day or they are not","motivated or they are feeling lazy um I might be able to cheer them up and uh try and refocus them. Um if they have a negative attitude uh I'll talk to them,","I'll let them vent, sometimes you just need someone to talk to. But eventually I'll turn around and I'll tell them, either hey we're almost there or uh we can","do this, I'll help you a little bit and uh we can get the test done, we can move on or it's not that bad. Um but uh I think being positive around them can","motivate them, have them focus on the future and and what we are meaning to achieve. And um specific situations would probably be uh in my high school setting","a lot of staff members would work double shifts which would be a sixteen hours shift and um mid-day when your ten hours in you should like you don't have any","energy anymore and you can't, get through the day. And that's when I might sit down with the staff member or um you know talk with them briefly aside um and","just be positive and just you know take a deep breath, um get your mind off it for a second, focus on other tasks. And uh usually uh the staff member would um","wound up thanking me and say maybe I did good and I helped them a little bit. And um like I said I think I'm a very positive person and I think uh it's all","about the perspective and the way you see things in life and I try and uh relay that to um staff members and friends when uh they are experiencing any",16,6
"16_segment-03","I think I've run into this problem uh many times in my last job uh at the same hospital that I worked in, in the ER. um There were two um members","of the staff that I was friends with, one of them as a little better friends with um the other one um was just liked by a lot of the staff. uh","She did a decent job so I didn't really have a problem with her but my one friend and her would always butt heads and um it became very difficult","to work with them sometimes. And I think that sometimes the patients had suffered because of this two and uh sometimes work won't get done. So","myself and a couple of other staff members um that were working, like I said this happened a lot. uh We'd always just try and separate them the","best we could put them in different sections of the ER, limit the contact and communication between the two and we would try and get done with","that shift and move on to the next day. um Neither one of them would ever let down or apologize or be the bigger man so to speak. But um I think","we did our best in trying to keep them separate and keep their focus on why we were there and what we were doing there. I think for the most part","uh it was successful, I think there were some instances where they may have gone into it or uh had a verbal argument or disagreement. But um I","always think that it could have been a lot worse than it was and I think that we did a good job with what we had and the resources that were",16,4
"16_segment-04","Well I think that's a tough question for me to answer uh I think that a lot of my employees and my co-workers uh did trust me.","Whenever they had a problem, gaining trust I think my actions spoke louder than my words, I think people saw that and knew that I was","uh uh reliable and uh if they needed anything I might be able to help them if not directly indirectly I might help solve a problem.","And I think that really showed a lot of people that I could be trusted. Uh But for certain employees it might be difficult with","trusting people, uh I think just whatever I said to them, it was very important to follow through and make them, see that I was good","for my word and I followed through everything that I ever said and uh earning trust was easy for me. I never really had a situation","where a co-worker did not trust me. Even the ones that I didn't get along with, uh they knew I was reliable and responsible and they","knew I could be counted on in tough situations. And uh But I cannot think of a time where I had to negotiate with someone in order to","gain their trust. I'm sure there has been instances but at this time I can't remember but my biggest thing would be following through","with what I say and meaning what I say and being honest with people. And I think that's how I would handle situations of trust with",16,4.8
"16_segment-05","Well I think this is another difficult question for me I think","uh a lot of my co-workers in the environment that I previously","worked at um we all took our share of the workload, we all got","together pretty well, got along with each other pretty well","rather. Uh But if ever there was actual work to be done uh [I","would], whether it was me or other staff members but we would","always compromise, we would always work together. Spread out the","workload, get everything that needed to be done done. And figure","whatever dilemmas whatever problems we encountered, we'd figure","out who needs to do what. Everyone gets their full share and get",16,4.8
"16_segment-06","I can specifically remember one uh instance where it was a group committee and um everyone was to come up with a couple ideas so","we could throw around uh during the meetings. And um I had proposed my idea in front of everyone, about ten to twelve members of","the committee. And uh one of the other employees who I got along with very well, um she had pointed out um certain weaknesses in","my proposal and shot it down right away and a couple of other people went along with her um opinion and her uh um ideas about my","proposal. um So that was given the axe right away um but the next time we met I kind of gathered all my thoughts and came back","with a better proposal. I um had my thoughts more organized um I kind of told them, I listened to all your ideas just give me a","shot I have a better way to present this idea to you and uh so I did. um We ultimately never wound up taking my idea but I did","get the floor and um I got my chance to speak and um it was a runner up um the second time we met. I was a runner up however the","first time they had blown me out of the water and I had no chance of getting my idea to the top. But after that second time I was","able to present it again and I had a successful outcome and uh it was taken into consideration and it was just beaten up by a",16,5
"16_segment-07","This is another instance that I have encountered frequently. I uh worked with one tech I'm going to elude back to my uh last job in the ER. Uh I had to","work with a care technician who I did not get along with. Uh I won't go far, I won't go as far as say I disliked her but uh we didn't get along. But um","every time we had to work together we were able to because we reminded ourselves of what we were there for, we were there to serve patients. And uh we","talked to each other very respectfully when we had to almost to sarcastic manner but uh we got the job done. And if ever she had said something uh a","little too out of line I just ignored it and I keep going because we understood that even though we didn't like each other we had to get along we had to","work with each other or else uh we would get in trouble from our superiors. And like I said if anything had happened um or she had said something mean","or mean spirited uh I'd ignore it and it never got to a very bad level. I mean it was unpleasant at times but uh we never got to the level I think we","both kind of knew our own lines, our own limits and we never crossed them and uh we had a successful working relationship even though we did not","especially like each other and uh I think it was about the respect that we had shared for each other, we were both hard workers. And uh I think uh I was","respectful of her ideas and she was respectful of mine and we got along just well enough to make sure that our department was functioning at the level",16,4.7
"16_segment-08","Well with this particular question I think I have to um answer it in a different couple of ways, a couple of different ways","rather. um I like having more work to do I don't like to be bored and I don't like to have nothing to do. So [I usually","encourage] uh I have a workload and usually uh I work harder and longer than others and that's fine because I believe I thrive","on that. um I believe the busier you are the faster time goes, um so I really never had a problem with doing more work. However","when it interfered with the completion of uh and the satisfaction of customers and clients um I'd have to tell a person that","either they need to pick up the slack or um I would go to a supervisor and tell them and they would either get written up or um","other disciplinary actions. But I give them the choice if you don't want to help me here, it's fine that, I might be doing a","little extra work but if the whole department is suffering because you're been lazy or you're not doing what you need to uh you","need to step it up or I will go to the supervisor and,um  but I always went to the employee first and uh let them know what I","felt and what I was observing and I gave the option of either um performing at the level needed or I would go to the supervisor",16,3.8
"16_segment-09","All during the two committees I served on at the last hospital I worked at, um uh both","times the group leader was the same and uh she was kind of um closed minded, she wasn't","really open to other people's ideas so she fits this example perfectly. She kind of had her","own ideas and ran with it and let everyone else contribute in a way that she wanted to","mould it and um come up with it. uh So she's a perfect example but um if I thought that","someone else or myself had a good idea I would politely bring that up to her and say I","think you are missing something here, I think this is a good point, I think this is a good","objective. um uh Both times they weren't successful, like I said she was very closed minded","and she didn't uh really accept anyone else's opinions or ideas. um But she was fine I","mean, that's the way it happened and I was okay with that.

"16_segment-10","I like this question too, I think I consider myself an expert listener, I see that a lot of times when there is a conversation between multiple people. Um There are","some people that wait to talk and there are some people that are listeners and uh then you can tell right away which people are which. And um for this question uh","there was one group member during my time at, NWP corporation uh and they felt that no one would listened to them, they thought that uh everyone kind of ignored her","and she was never invited to social events and uh she wasn't invited to lunch. She really felt like her ideas weren't being uh considered um and I had always gotten","along with her. Uh our group, uh in our group a couple of people hadn't gotten along with her and uh but like I said I never had a problem with her and uh so after","she told me that, she expressed her feelings and I said all right well I understand why you feel that way. You know maybe you need to speak up more but from that","point on I had made an effort to listen to her and every time I did, we would have a good conversation go back and forth. And to show that I really was listening","and I truly did care, a week later, two weeks later I'd ask her hey, how's this person, what's going on with this project, her work, if any uh personal problems or","issues, or just anything that she mentioned I'd make a point to um get back to her and ask her about it. To really make sure that she knew I was listening, I was","actively listening and I cared and I think uh she appreciated that and she did definitely see once I made that effort uh she was able to see that I did listen and I",16,5.8
"16_segment-11","Well this has to be one of the most difficult questions uh you could ask somebody. It's the most difficult question, I'm sorry tasks uh employee would have to do in their uh","work. It's to criticize a supervisor try to uh improve their methods or their ways. um Luckily in my experience I've had great supervisors, uh we got along very well. um So","I was always able to come to them and say, we might be able to make an improvement here or, I don't know if criticize is the right word but uh like I said we had a very open","relationship if they told me that I had to work on something, I'd accept it, no hard feelings and that was it and I did the same with them. If ever uh there was a time where","I didn't feel comfortable telling them something or um volunteering opinion on some way to do something better I would tell them, uh sometimes jokingly. But uh my one","supervisor she always got the point if you said something jokingly she knew that there was something behind it and um so she works on it couple days later she'd say hey do","you really mean what you said I know you were kidding. But I'd say yeah well maybe just a little bit and she'd work on it and it was successful. um But I always thought that","if ever there was something you could never say to a supervisor um you could write an anonymous letter or a note and leave it for them and that way no feelings are hurt or","no relationships are tested or harmed in that um way. So I always thought an anonymous note would be appropriate. um But like I said I've had um, if I'd been very lucky um","with my supervisors and I was able to be open and honest with them, just like they were with me and it was a blessing for me to work for someone who I truly liked and truly",16,3.4
"16_segment-12","uh That was a very difficult thing to do especially in the medical field, um when patients would uh excuse me, ask a question","about a procedure or an injury or an illness um we had to um really get down their level and explain the layman's terms from step","one we had to teach the anatomy and the physiology about a body part before we could explain what the disease was doing, what the","disease was about. um So we had to basically start from step one and really outline everything thoroughly before we could explain","what was going on. We had to talk to them as if they were in middle school, a parent of a child, or an adult. We'd have to speak","to them in a very simple form a very um small words and after we finish it all we had to say okay do you understand? If they said","yes we would continue, we'd go on to the next thing. um Sometimes we would use analogies to um relate to them maybe something that","they might be familiar with. um So uh really the biggest thing would be being patient with them and making sure that every little","step that they understood before you move onto the next component and speaking to them in very simple language and really not","using any complex vocabulary. uh That was the best way we could um communicate what needed to be said to the patients and their",16,6.6
"20_segment-01","Okay, there is a time when uh I first started here at ETS in which I come from a position which I was in control, I was","managing a lot of conferences. Uh So however with this new role at ETS I was not in the managing role but more as a supportive","role for the AP reading in Cincinnati. One of the biggest issues that we had had was the one subject Spanish language not","finishing on time and there were a lot of suggestions that I had to improve the reading quality to make sure that things ran","more smoothly. uh Coming into the reading it was very difficult uh because I was younger than a lot of people and didn't have","nearly as much of experience so I was always looking for how could we change and make things better. So what I would do to uh","give my suggestions is I would go to those in leadership and provide what I thought would be a solution to a problem I was","seeing. So I would already, present a solution and gain their approvals to whether or not they thought that would be a good","idea as well. So by doing that I was able to put my thoughts forward, present a leadership position without overstepping","boundaries and stepping on anyone's toes per say. So in the end, what we were able to do was have a successful reading and",20,5.2
"20_segment-02","One of my previous positions I worked for the American Diabetes Association in which I coordinated the annual American's walk for diabetes in various communities within Pennsylvania. There was one area","in particular, it was in Wellsboro which is about two hours North of Harrisburg in a very remote town that's not very big. And however they took great pride in their walk and every year I would receive","fund-raising goals from our National office that would say you need to reach this area, you need to reach amount and you need to reach this goal and if not something is not being done right. So","Wellsboro was an area in which for the last couple of years the fund-raising had declined year after year after year. So my goal was to go out into the town and find out what was it that they were","having problems with and where did this issues lie. And what I learned when I actually made my face to face visit is that I was the first person in three years that had actually been out to the","community to sit down and meet with them and listen to what they had to say. And that was a shock for me, I was very young, it was my first job right out of college to sort of find out that the","expectation for a community to raise thirty thousand dollars without ever having a presence from someone was quite appalling to me. So we sat down together as a group to talk about different fund-","raising ideas, what were the different things that they could do to gain interest within the community. How to get the community involved. So by actually sitting down and listening to their concerns","and working with them to reach a goal, not only were we able to surpass the thirty thousand dollars fund-raising goal set forth by our national office. But we were actually even able to surpass that by","quite a lot by actually raising seventy five thousands dollars. So for me it was a great learning experience to go in and listen to what people had to say and build more communication skills that way",20,5.7
"20_segment-03","So a time when co-workers of mine did not work well together on a project. I can only speak from personal experience that it may have been myself that was one of the more difficult people to","work with and again I go back to learning experiences when I was young and just starting out my professional career while working uh for the American Diabetes Association which we relied","very heavily on the community to be members of a community, to help with fund-raising efforts, getting the message out to the community. And so another one of my areas was Lancaster","Pennsylvania in which uh for the last previous years they had had a different staff representative help manage their walks. So obviously there was a lot of unhappiness with everyone on the","community you had people who were vice presidents and CEOs have companies that were dedicating their time and uh possibly even resources and money to participate in events. And one area","where we constantly struggled with was obtaining media coverage for the event. How do we get the information out there, the radio stations, the TV stations etcetera. And there was one","gentleman in particular who was very frustrated who uh wanted to know how many radio stations were in the area and what could we do to reach out to them. In which my response was very naive","and inappropriate I said, I don't know open up the phone book and figure it out. So needless to say I was then known as the one person that had problems working with people and committees in","the area and learned very quickly how to go about and improve my communication skills so as not to become that person. And took it as a good learning experience and not a negative way uh","from the situation and have build up on that and it definitely makes me think twice before I say something during a group project and criticize someone else when I myself may not have the",20,3
"20_segment-04","For my second job when I was in my career I worked for a codings company, coding as in the paint on your car or the vanish on the deck that type of coding. um In which the","organization was very small and majority of my thirteen co-workers had worked together for over twenty years. So to come into a company that was very closely knit as a family to","begin with and as an outsider and presumably much younger than everyone else was very difficult. um Especially since the Director who hired me was fired only after a month of my","being there and they moved me into his position. So as I had ideas of the conferences that we were putting on for various topics which is what coding means or car codings etcetera.","uh There was a lot of um working that I had to do with people who were very stuck in the same way that they had done this for years, years and years and were even angry at the fact","that my predecessor had been let go so suddenly. So it was taking the time to get to know individuals and listening to how they had done things in the past and realizing that if an","organization had been in business for eighty or ninety years that maybe they did know something about what they were doing. However it is always good to try new things so rather than","radically change a program at a time I would maybe change one or two aspects to the program and see how well they were received. What example would be how we digitize the technical","presentations that were given at our conferences instead of just providing a handout to all the reader, to all the attendees. Actually provide them with the disks they were able to","take that information back to their companies and share it with their employees. Thinking that this was a way that you would be able to share the information and even gain greater",20,5.7
"20_segment-05","Anyone who has worked with committees or volunteers knows that it can be a very difficult thing to do time after time and even when they can be what we call paid volunteers such as with a chief aids that we hire","for AP readings every year. I mean as I previously mentioned Spanish was, is one of the subjects that for twenty-three years has never finished on time, had never finished on time and was very hard to keep our","chief aids happy and keep them going year after year after year. um For those who may have not been familiar with Spanish there is a speaking and a writing component to it. So there is the movement on a lot of","books or tapes or CDs  at any one given time. And a chief aid for a Spanish speaking was having a very difficult time for the last couple years and she was a teacher herself so she knew what it was like to work","hard and work with uh students as well which was a lot of her assistance at that time. And so year after year she would just get beat down with people who wouldn't listen, wouldn't work with her and did not want","to come back. However with her she had this wealth of knowledge that was very hard to share with other people who had never had this responsibility before. So one of the things I sat down and I did with her is I","listened to what her chief complains were and I said okay, if we can make these changes and if we can make things easier for you will you stay on another year. Practically begging her to stay on and help with us","and teach us what you know and ask us what can we do to help you in return. And from that we were able to build training materials that she would share out with her reading assistance to make it easier and we were","then actually able to implement to multiple subjects at the same reading sites as well. And through the success of that one year of listening to her and begging her to come back, she was actually able to stay on","for a couple more years until it was actually a job commitment for her employer that kept her away from coming back for the next couple of years. So definitely begging and helping out can work at times and other",20,5.4
"20_segment-06","When I worked at the codings company there was a time when we were experiencing some financial difficulties. And I was looking through magazines","and the Internet to see what other research topics were popular and what other conferences were covering. And there was one in particular about a","new initiative that was happening in Europe. And so I was able to convince my manager at the time to send me to this conference in Germany on this","topic called Reach and to get a better understanding of what it was about. And make some contacts to come back and develop our own program on Reach","at our International meeting in Canada. And so um it was very hard to accept especially when your company is having a financial difficulties to","send you overseas to attend a conference like that. But the outcome was beneficial, in that we were able to make contacts with other people and get","some great papers on the topic, because even though the program of Reach was happening in Europe there was a lot of US based manufacturers that","would do business with European countries in which their materials would have to be in alignment with the rules and regulations as they apply to","Europe. So in the sense that you were not only benefiting the company by attending you were also benefiting the industry as well and providing a","service and with the primary goal of our organization to provide the technical based research that they're needed in this companies, it was a win-",20,5.4
"20_segment-07","I think at some point in our life we all have to work with people who we don't like and it can even stem back as far as childhood when if you come from a large family like I do you're forced to","do things with your brothers and sisters even though you may not like them at the time. So at a young age I learnt very quickly how to work with people who you may not like at a particular time","and as I've encountered this in my professional career. um There was a particular person who actually sat next to me here at ETS is to work next part over. And we had turned out as okay friends","but as the months had kind of gone on her little behavior started to annoy me greatly. uh You know typing up the keys on the keyboard always sounded very angry and her constant talk about getting","married and everyday problems with, the venue or the flowers or etcetera. Could really start to get on a person's nerve after a while. So when we were required to do a project together it was the","least desirable opportunity I would say. um However having learnt from previous experiences about working with people, you really have to put those personal feelings aside and really just","concentrate on the work and divide the tasks equally amongst each other. So you would some independent work to do and then come together when needed to discuss what those outcomes were for the","project and if they met the project demands. So [this way] by operating together you're still able to complete separate work and not create continual conflict at any given time. Ah Another great","opportunity is anytime you are on-site as either a subject leader certainly for the AP reading you'll come across many readers who are very frustrated with travel plans or what not their hotel","arrangements, their roommates. And so you really need to draw that fine line and realize what's the source of the problem, how can you fix it to make sure that all the parties involved have a",20,5.1
"20_segment-08","I don't think I've ever really been given a task that I found more unpleasant or tedious than what other co-workers of mine have been given.","I'm a very positive person and so I take on each task as a challenge and I also like to be in control so if sometimes a task may seem more","tedious or demand more of me I look at it as an opportunity to grow and to getting you to lead. Again I can't say more than when you're at","the AP reading especially in Cincinnati where you have the languages and the tapes and CDs you know you're constantly been pulled in every","direction and you're working fourteen, sixteen hour days, you're on your feet all the time um and your name is constantly being yelled over","the walkie talkies. However I thrive in that type of environment I enjoy that type of environment. uh For me if it's a chaotic environment","but to the outside person it looks like everything is running smoothly and there are no problems. And college board representatives don't","know that their front readers have stage mumble because they don't like the way the sound comes out of the headphones on the tape recorders","then I've done my job. You know, so if it looks like everything is going smoothly and I'm able to delegate tasks that can be done by other","people as well as still meet the demands of everything else that's going on then, I thrive in it. I enjoy it. And I think it only makes you a",20,5.9
"20_segment-09","I think anytime someone takes over a leadership position and is not willing to accept the contributions from someone within their group then they are not really that great of a leader.","Uh You know, a great leader someone who is willing to listen to what his or her co-workers are willing to say and provide input or feedback to what it is that they are saying. And a lot","of times there are terrible ideas that are thrown out, there which may not be in alignment with this scope of work for the project however it's still always important to listen to what","those uh suggestions are. And for me if I was that person who was continuing to provide suggestions and receive no feedback or was ignored, I don't think it would stop me from doing","that. I like to present my ideas and solutions to a problem if I think that they would be beneficial. Being brought up well if there is no wrong answer or stupid question doesn't always","apply. I think in a corporate world so you want to think thoroughly about what your suggestions are and maybe take a queue from what your leader is saying to you and that if they are","really leaning on a certain direction maybe trying to give some of your feedback that leads in that direction. But if you're continuing to be ignored and you think that it's not helpful","to the project or the overall beneficial to the company then at that point yes there is the opportunity to go to your manager and say that you feel very frustrated with the project. And","either ask them for some guidance or other things that you can do, uh some of it may just be suck it up and deal with it. Uh But at least you raised these concerns and you expressed them","and you weren't afraid to which I think is part of it. Because it may be that this new leaders uh half of how they see the project going really isn't in alignment with what the company",20,5.4
"20_segment-10","My current role here at ETS, I'm a client manager which I work very closely with the college board on a daily basis. So definitely listening is the big part of my work load.","Especially if it leads to the multiple change class back coming from college board on a daily basis for the AP program. And especially as we are now developing a new test","computer science principles, there is a lot of assumptions and scope of work that really needs to be captured and gathered accurately. And shared with all the stakeholders","properly so everyone who is in alignment with what the expectations are from the board. uh In particularly on just a call today which we were trying to align on the definitions","that we use for our pilot reading and samples and so here college board was using the definitions of samples quite differently than the way ETS defines samples. The way ETS","defines samples is, just that a sample of a student's response to a question and which that response is used to train readers how to provide scores. Whereas here college board","was using the word sample as just a response, it's not anything you used to train anyone but just purely as a student's response. So one thing that I would do when I'm having","these conference calls and I'm trying to listen to all the different areas, uh for as scope of work that college board is presenting as I would repeat back what it is that I'm","hearing to make sure that I've accurately captured the information so not examples as samples I would say so what I'm hearing is you define sample is this and repeat it back","and gain, clarification. So this way when I then present the information to our test development staff they also have a clear understanding of how college board is defining",20,6.2
"20_segment-11","When I worked at the American Diabetes Association I would occasionally make the mistake of just walking into my manager's office and","blotting out information. I since learnt that that is an inappropriate process and the correct process would be is if it's vital","information to maybe knock your supervisor's door and to let them know that you are standing there uh taking evaluation of who may or may","not be in the room instead of just letting out information. So as I've taken this now many years later into my professional development.","One thing that I'll do when uh there's a very critical piece of information that I need to provide to a supervisor is first I would","collect my thoughts and make sure that I've accurately captured what it is that, the information that it is that I need to provide, does","it relate to budget. Does it relate to read insight impact or anything like that. um Instead what I would do is I would send an e-mail to","my manager and say I would like to sit down and talk to you uh this issue has arise and kind of lay out exactly what points it is I'd","like to cover. And instead of sometime, to sit down and talk with that individual face to face, so we can walk logically through the","questions that I've come out of this issue and how we would like to tackle them and move forward um instead of just blotting out the",20,5.3
"20_segment-12","I would say that the majority of my jobs have been very difficult to explain to my family members. Not that they are not smart people but just that what I do seems to be very complex on a very broad scale and how","do you narrow down more specifically what it is that I do on a daily basis can sometimes be hard. For example when I worked for the codings industry people thought I make paint which obviously I didn't but to say","oh I design technical conferences for people in the codings industry they had a hard time grasping. And I find that to be true here as well at ETS that explaining to people what a reading is, what a response is a","reader and all the abbreviations that ETS uses. For example CR could have multiple definitions. Could be a Chief Reader, could be a Change request or could be a constructed response. So, really is almost like","talking uh in a foreign tongue to a lot of my family members. So it's really important that I kind of break things down into pieces that they would kind of understand and hopefully not after two minutes lose","interest in what it is that I'm saying which at times does happen. So again that all goes back to taking what could be a very complex thing and how do you make it manageable for someone. So it's looking at what the","most reliable or relate-able aspect of what it is that I do to everyone and how do I relate it to the audience that I'm speaking to. So for example for, all the work that I do on AP I would usually start with","saying so did any of your children or do you know anyone who maybe took an AP exam when they were in high school. And from there back out what's some of the more details are as it relates to it. So I'd say okay,","you saw the students, saw your child would write an essay and then the school would send back that essay what my complain does is we gather all the essays together and we send them to our conventions center where","we have people come and sit for seven days and score them. Now, there are so many details that go into that but, uh when they start to lose interest I think they would but they get the general idea of what it is",20,5.4
"21_segment-01","There was a time that, uh at uh the time when I was working at Marsh um the company had grown by acquisition over the prior few years and uh they were faced","with one of those typical IT situations where they had multiple systems storing the same kinds of data. um But systems that didn't talk to each other,","different coding arrangements. Okay, this was a system, these were systems that recorded information uh about the particular um insurance carriers and","underwriters that they, that Marsh worked with. Remember Marsh was a giant insurance brokerage firm, so they basically placed business with insurance companies","all over the world. um I was, that was also the early point of data warehousing in organizations. So often and I almost use data warehousing with air quotes,","because often uh single purpose uh structures and small systems were developed uh to be able to answer maybe one or two particular questions. uh Somebody in","the business, uh of course being in IT, somebody in the business uh  wanted to start to harmonize the different coding systems that were used to represent","carriers or insurers across uh many of the different systems both uh that had sprung up within Marsh globally and the systems of, uh the systems across uh","their acquisitions. um I took the lead on devising ways to um work with those, with folks in those systems to um basically uh determine what was the standard","that the company was going to use and helping the different systems map to that standard and devising some mechanisms and processing at uh, in the ware house",21,5.2
"21_segment-02","Several years ago the first job that I uh had straight out of college was for the FDNY. And we were in the Operations Research Group, we supported management in a lot of","different, um basically numbers people. We supported a lot of initiatives and one of which was uh collective bargaining. Because um basically that's where um all staffing and","really substantial changes take place is through the contracting and collective bargaining process. uh We had a very ambitious uh really great Deputy Commissioner who came up","with a uh very good plan for reducing staffing under certain circumstances and we had to prove that those reductions in staffing uh would not be detrimental either to the","public or to the firefighters themselves. So we were faced with the task of going to you know some old storage rooms gathering tons of paper documents and um we had to build","screens, this was a long time ago, data bases were simple. We had to build screens, we had to get data input, we had to do some modeling to figure out, you know, to actually","analyze the situation. To see whether uh more injuries resulted when staffing was reduced uh under certain circumstances in the past. So, well basically um just by being very","honest, by being very collaborative with my coworkers, you know get in the car, ride out to the site where we have to try to wrestle these boxes away from folks. And you know","get back and you know just, so basically facing the task down, um making a plan and sticking with it although being able to um diverge from our plans if we needed to based","what the circumstances were, everything was very fluid.

Well you can't","completely handle it because you can't necessarily get to the actual source of the friction but you obviously have to do your best. Uh Basically I always try to","acknowledge the points that each person had. Uh I tried to stay out of non work disagreements because those things popped up as well and I tried to just uh point","out that those sorts of things were not even uh, that we shouldn't even be discussing or arguing over those types of things at work. Uh When, as I said when it came","to work disagreements I would basically hear each person out [and try to], I mean in my mind I might have leaned towards one person or the other persons opinion.","Chances are I'd have my own opinion uh [and I would try to] basically sometimes you need to ask people questions, to get them to perhaps think of things in a","different way. Um Uh One of the different ways being to try to see the other persons perspective and where they're coming from. Um I can think of one particular","incident where I literally got between uh two people and uh two much larger men and frankly that was not a great outcome because um Uh I felt that my physical","presence between them would stop fighting but I myself became scared because it looked like that wasn't going to make any difference. Um [Generally when it come],","my preference is to talk things out and then to make a decision without saying who's right and who's wrong. Just saying Okay, if I'm the manager this is my decision",21,5.8
"21_segment-04","There have been quite a few times where I've been in a position uh as a data analyst to um take a look at data that's going to be merged, integrated, harmonized in some","target warehouse system. And to determine and define rules for processing, transformation, um you know error conditions. um So I've often had to gain, I wouldn't say the","'trust' but the 'buy in' of the folks to whom I was giving direction. uh Typically they'd be developers, I would have to, you have to be able to answer their questions, um","you have to be able to give them all answers that are fairly robust so that, um you know which lets them know that you've analyzed the situation and you have thought about","it. And you have um determined uh how to deal with, you know maybe ninty percent of problems is always going to be weird data that you may not be able to plan for, um","although you need a catch all way to deal with that as well. um I mean the outcomes of those kinds of situations just generally uh work well because if, the things is if","you're defining the rules for somebody else. And perhaps there was an oversight on my part, um you know I'm willing, perfectly willing and perfectly able and expecting to you","know take the flak if there was any issues that their code didn't handle because I didn't give them the correct instructions. So when those kinds of things happened and you","basically, um you know stand up in a meeting, take responsibility for whatever you've done.

"21_segment-05","I'm hard pressed to come up with an individual circumstance of this because generally speaking at least with my work experience, you know work is","a day to day is a series of compromises often small, uh nothing earth shattering. Uh I think that my, uh often with my role uh as a data analyst","is really not often a lot of compromise, uh well actually I can think of one circumstance. We built a tool to be able to do um uh staffing uh","analysis and staffing and geospatial location analysis. And uh I was called upon by uh somebody well above me to use that tool in a way that it","hadn't been designed for. Uh I can't say that was an example of a compromise because we had to do it. Uh So it's not a good example. Uh The","outcome was okay though, we felt reasonably confident with the results, we just had a completely different set of data as input to this model,","something that we hadn't originally planned for.

It's day","to day, in the mundane world database design, there's naming conventions, little arguments about naming or sometimes about structure. And you","just look at the pros and cons, work with the developers see perhaps, you know obviously take their input where do they think it'll be a little","bit easier and you know for them or make their work a little bit more um standardized and go from there.

"21_segment-06","There was a time when uh at a particular uh job of mine that we were planning to design a, we were designing an enterprise wide data model,","logical model. And uh we were adding, you know you're kind of adding to it in sort of subject areas and pieces. And we wanted to, I wanted to add","a kind of a meta data layer that was kind of rules about who owned which pieces of the model. I mean in reality once this thing was instantiated,","not who owned the model itself but who owned the data once the model is instantiated. Uh and uh we want, and so I wanted to have a uh meta data","layer that defined who, who as a group or as an individual is responsible for which data. Also defining which roles can be assigned to different","entities in this world, you know say customer. What role, or a party and what roles they can play within the organization or vis-a-vis their own","organization. So uh basically I presented this concept of a meta data layer which was informed by some uh industry research, by a particular uh","designer. And uh the outcome was favorable and we did put that layer into the model and we begin instantiating, we instantiated that so as we","brought applications into that platform, the enterprise wide platform that was being built out, uh the meta data was uh we made use of and","populated the meta data structures uh which not only governed behavior but also give a reference data and informational data for folks just",21,4.9
"21_segment-07","I had a particular consulting assignment that was a purely virtual team, uh everybody in my group, we all worked from home. And we had no Skype or any kind of visual visual","aids shall we say, so we spent a lot of time on the phone, a lot of time IM'ing. And because of it being a virtual team there were folks from you know potentially all over","the country and there were some, there was one particular per person from the Midwest who I will say I 'did not dislike,' I did not think that I did not get along with her.","However I found out that uh the engagement styles of different folks vary and interestingly enough even though none of us have ever had ever met um I still found out","indirectly that my behavior was bothering her. that I don't know maybe being a New Yorker uh we're theoretically more aggressive, I I don't know. But um I found out that","she didn't she thought I was being too too uh aggressive and too, perhaps, I don't know, discussing things a little too, in too much of a heated fashion. Although obviously","there always another person I engage in that kind of discussion. um [the] [I real] The outcome for me was that I tried to um uh not respond so quickly uh when asked a","question you know  on one of our numerous teleconference calls,you know when when we were on a call with him the person who was our boss. um I tried to  uh I tried to be","what I guess what to me is kind of extra polite. It was really to me an eye opener in terms of like different styles because I really didn't think I was the most aggressive","person in the room. I rarely am but apparently it's all relative. So um I tried to uh be a little more restrained in our in our discussions, but what else can I do, I still",21,5.4
"21_segment-08","Software testing is a very, you know very important process, a very important part of the software development life cycle. um And there are definitely","experts in that area, there are tools that facilitate test case and um design, regression testing, all that sort of stuff. I've been in a situation where","as a uh data modeler I needed to evaluate a uh new version of the software that we used, the modeling software that we used. I found it not so much","tedious, I found it unpleasant because I felt that I was in a position to not be as comprehensive as uh perhaps one needed to be to test all, to define","enough test cases and to go through them thoroughly to be able to really test, regression test all the existing functionality plus the new functionality.","um I did my best, plus uh I did not inherit any test plans that may have existed uh within the organization uh around prior upgrades of the same","software. So what could I do uh to find the test, define a test plan as comprehensively as possible because many steps as I think I need and just plough","through it. I mean I had to put in extra time um because I really wanted to feel that I had covered all the bases. This was a piece of software that has","a lot of functionality. So it's very hard to control, change one thing, test. It was um a little, I was a little stifled by all of the, uh by trying to","be comprehensive. But the outcome was that I tested it, I tested the basic functionality that we use and was able to uh report yea or nay whether the",21,5.2
"21_segment-09","I was involved in a large project that, uh around merging uh municipal agencies. And being the Operations Research Group we wanted to be very","thorough in our analysis of impact of uh increased uh responsibilities on the particular, uh on a particular force. And certain analysis","pointed to, analysis, we performed various analysis to try to gauge the impact of projected increase in work. uh We, the person who was heading","the entire project uh [typically did not want], [well people], [it was almost a foregone conclusion], [so this], [so we didn't want to really","entertain], he didn't really want to entertain um number and stats that didn't, that looked as, that made the merger look, um you know less","than ideal. uh [It was handled], basically we need to take our cues from him and ultimately we did. Because you know this is information going","outside of the department and we simply had to, we had to tow the line. um And which I did, I was quite young at that point. um But we did all","the, we floated some of this information with other groups that also had uh a stake in this merger. um Just so, you know, just so people were","aware that kind of what the numbers were that we were coming up with and whether or not they thought folks who were more experienced than us,","whether they thought they were significant. So basically I kept the lines of communication open with all the involved parties but I did have to",21,4.2
"21_segment-10","I'll go back to my example when I was working on a completely virtual team. Uh basically listening skills were all you had, whenever we were meeting as","a group, meeting with business folks, it was always uh only on the phone. So essentially it's almost like being blind so the listening skills really","have to be honed. Uh [in order to], it made me value uh visual cues at meetings. Because often if somebody is about to start to talk you don't just jump","in to cut them off or at least you probably don't want to. Uh so, but you don't have those visual cues while everybody's on the phone. So I developed, I","just tried to develop, be very attuned to even noises, like maybe somebody clearing their throat, like maybe somebody is about to talk. I wouldn't say","we had one specific problem to deal with, the problem was uh managing the conversation where there were no visual cues. So basically a little bit more","pausing, I mean the behaviors that you have to employ are maybe pausing a little bit longer, listening for noises that aren't words. Uh uh and [just","being], uh really learning people's voices and learning a little bit about folks vocal habits, uh some people will pause for effect but not because","they're finished. Uh so you know the outcome was that we all you know learned to work together, we learned to be a little bit more attuned and maybe","almost like hyper polite because of the lack of the visual. Uh and eventually we just learned each others mode of communication and we got the work done",21,6
"21_segment-11","Back to my analysis on um working permissibly to see when we were locking on a merger between two different agencies. Numbers","that we ran based on models that we had used over time so not a model that was, not a series of equal, you know models that were","developed just for the purpose of analyzing the merger but models that we used to measure activity prior to the merger. uh We","used some of that and we were showing that there would be a statistically significant um impact on certain parts of the city, um","using expected post merger biometrics. um I brought those numbers to my managers attention, he's first questions was Who else","have we showed the numbers to? um Which I said No one. And you know basically uh I believe that the outcome was that he viewed me","with suspicion. I don't know if uh I did the right thing by bringing those numbers to him but they were, we had confidence in","their validity or in the validity of the way we had computed them. And I felt, I'm an extremely honest person it's like I don't,","I don't see the virtue of trying to hide information because it will out no matter what. uh  And uh often with um worse","consequence if it's uh perceived that you attempted to hide things. So the outcome was that I don't think it was very favorable",21,5.6
"21_segment-12","Actually again with, uh with regard to that merger, uh because we use certain statistical techniques to describe what to project, the expected impact","uh on the uh organization based on changes that were coming, we needed to explain that. We, so we produced a lot of information and some visuals as","well, and visual pictures of changed activity. And we needed to present that to the head of our organization who then had to go before uh some","Municipal uh City Council. Um basically we reviewed the you know the basic all, excuse me, the basic statistical approach is that we took, without","getting into too much detail. Uh we talked about how we had vetted the model that we used for the, for these predictions. And you know that was about","it, whatever questions he asked, we made sure that we had, you know, we could, we explained. Um he was uh not tech, again he was not technical. So uh","he wasn't asking the most technical questions about the real underlying uh guts of these models. Um I think the situation worked out fine because","ultimately it was kind of 'all's well that ends well' because um the audience that he faced at the City Council were not really asking for heavy duty","technical details as well. So uh you know [nothing], we didn't have to explain anything very technical because we weren't asked and perhaps he knew","all along that he wouldn't get those kinds of technical questions so he went easy on us. But we did the best and got into as much detail as he could",21,3.7
"22_segment-01","I was working um with some colleagues on a report that we needed to um provide that was going to be part of a larger um report. mmm","Some of the people had a lot of detail background information about what we needed to be doing in the report, other people didn't","have as much of a background. [So what I did was to], um and the people who had more information about the uh gender studies I had","them, um you know draft some initial information, others who didn't have as much um background I had them um go and um find out a","little bit more about by talking or reading either some, some different um literature that I had suggested. I spoke with each person","individually before we had a large group meeting then during the large group meeting people were able to um talk about their ideas.","We wrote them down and drafted uh the report and looked at that report together. In the end it was a much stronger report because a","lot of the people who thought that they were experts in the area um you know came up with responses, you know responses that they","thought were understandable to everyone. But people who hadn't had as much experience asked some really good questions. And so in the","end everyone was very pleased with the report and everyone felt that they had learned a whole lot from you know having done it the",22,5.8
"22_segment-02","We were preparing for an annual meeting in another city and there were two thousand people who were expected to attend. The week before one of the employees was really sick and wasn't","able to really participate the way we would have needed to have everybody pull together in order to make sure that the meeting was very successful. Uh We talked about hiring someone else","or getting someone in short term as a group but felt that it would take a lot more time to bring that close enough to speed about what needed to be done as opposed to doing it ourselves.","Uh So we decided uh that we were going to uh simply move ahead with what needed to be done. We came up with a list of everything that needed to be done that the other person would have,","you know that the other member of our group would have normally been doing, uh and then each of us talked about what we'll do this. We divided it up and we then worked pretty much around","the clock, you know checking in with one another, coming in early and building a really strong collegial uh team and making sure that everything went on without a hitch. And in the end we","were really surprised by how much we were able to streamline things because being under the gun like that we found a lot of with what we were doing on the one versus eighteen with making","the registration badges for example. We didn't need to do it that way uh and coming up with a way of labeling who was responsible for which of the boxes, when they were going to arrive in","the hotel, we found another way of doing that. So the crisis situation uh really helped us to change a lot of what we did on a daily basis, so we had the added uh benefit of being able to","uh streamline [our], what we did and then because of that we were able to then take on more work so the next time and the next when we had the annual meeting it didn't take as much of our",22,5.3
"22_segment-03","I was working on a high level team in which none of us had um chosen to come together. I was the only one that um the leader of the team had brought in for","my outside expertise, and the others had come from different departments within that um uh organization as well as another organization. It became very","clear from the beginning that although we all agreed what needed to be done, there were two members who didn't get who didn't um agree with how we should do","it or who should take the lead on doing different things and so every meeting um just would deteriorate into one person saying what he thought should be","done and the other person saying what she thought should be done. I listened to them both in the different meetings and I understood that they were actually","saying the same thing usually um although their perspective might differ a bit. So I spoke to each one of them individually um and you know just tried to","get to know them as people and then tried also to uh during the meeting you know interpret if you will uh what the one was saying to the other so that we","could, they could have, everyone could see that the were in agreement when they actually thought that they were in disagreement. um That worked uh pretty","well. um After a month or so it seemed determinable at the time, but after a month they became really good friends uh because they were able to see that uh","they would, had a lot more in common than they actually differed uh in the topic or in the issue that we were working and um working together to write a",22,6.2
"22_segment-04","It was my job to help our association to find um adequate hotels for our annual meeting of two thousand people which also included an exhibit hall of fifty to sixty different exhibitors. And so, and we needed","to have uh different spaces, large conference rooms, small conference rooms uh and also auditoriums and a place for doing a dance. So it was a very, it's a very um unique hotel that can take all of those","characteristics and be able to also provide a very good meeting um for the members of the association. What it meant was ensuring that everything that we needed, all the specifications were there, uh the hotel","could handle as well as trying to get the best possible price for the facilities because our members um as I always liked to tell them did not have deep pockets and so the room rate needed to be very reasonable","and it is that many of them are flying from all, all corners of the globe in order to be together yet that was, you know it's an annual meeting. It was the time that they came together for networking uh and uh","seeing their colleagues and so it was very important that then we would all be, you know would all be able to attend. It meant that we would need to you know have several meetings, first by phone to talk about","what the specifications were and then initially understand that yes, you know they did have a meeting space that I required for our meeting, then um going out to have to do a site visit, and during the site","meeting establishing a report, you know, looking at the facilities, trying to imagine what each of the rooms would be used for. um Either this could be for the dance, this is the exhibit hall, uh and helping","them to understand our organization so that they you know, could they really take care of us as individuals as well as the, the collective group. uh But still understanding that they need to have, give us the","best possible price.

I shared the draft report with the head of the organization who was not at all pleased. Uh she felt that it didn't really give a","clear example or give a clear sense of what her organization uh comparative advantage was over others and that it would guarantee that she would get the funding um","from the organization that I was working for, the grant maker.

We talked about it at length and I tried to see her perspective, I think she understood mine a lot","better um and it helped her also to then think about her staffing.

"22_segment-06","I was working with a group of people uh to come up with a position paper about gender equality, and many of the people in the group rejected even the term gender equality.

I persisted and I said that we needed to use gender equality. People wrote different parts of the overall manifesto as we were calling it uh and didn't","use the terminology. I would go back and talk to them individually to show how they can incorporate it, how they could make and understood within the context because some were","looking at it from a political background view point others from an economic, uh still others were really looking at it at the cultural uses of the term.

So I really I kind of","went around the situation by reassigning task to uh the on boarding specialist instead of uh having the saucers uh take on more responsibilities.","um If there was a step that I felt that the saucers could step in to uh help with getting this task done quickly then I would ask, and usually they",23,3.3
"23_segment-04","uh Recently at ETS I changed job positions uh from one department to another but within the same uh area, SWS. um I went from uh working","independently to having to rely on my new coworkers to teach me the new position. uh I was assigned one assistant in particular to uh help me","understand the new position. She was somewhat disengaged and not really all that involved in making sure that I understood the whole process. uh I","had to make sure that I asked the proper questions, um and because it was a slow time of year which it usually is at the end of the summer for","hiring I didn't really have the opportunity to make this a situational opportunity to learn. uh So when she finished showing me the basics I then","took it upon myself to uh make sure that the recruiter and I had a good relationship so that I could finish my learning which would be on the job","learning uh at a busy time through the recruiter. uh I managed to come up with my own system or tracking the work and being able to uh present","statistics based on Excel Spreadsheet that I created and it presented a good opportunity for us to keep track of records and run reports out of my","own Excel Spreadsheets uh and that he was agreeable on that so that we wouldn't have to rely on pair less uh because there were some uh  rumors and","some talk that we were going to be loosing that report system and we wanted to make sure that we had a way of keeping our data of where he was with",23,4.2
"23_segment-05","In this situation I'm going to describe uh a situation where I was working as a case manger. Uh There was a policy set in place by the community","mental health center that I worked for that stated that there should always be two case managers out in the community on a case all the time. Reality","was that never happened uh so there were times that I felt it was important that another case manager be with me in particular when I was transporting","a male from the prison system back into the community and that actually uh believe it or not required some finagling and getting my male uh","counterparts to stop what they were doing on their case loads, which were actually pretty heavy, and come on to this uh transfer with me in getting a","male, uh it was really a client back into a community. Uh Usually it involved taking my coworkers out to lunch or stay and I'll come in and cover","certain cases for them, uh even though it was still part of the job requirement the reality is case workers' loads are just too heavy and it doesn't","happen. So uh within the group itself you have to develop relationships with each of the case workers and make sure that uh you help them out on","errand situations. Uh There are many times I have females as well. They are more comfortable with having the female with them so that situations uh","don't occur uh that could be mentally harmful to the case manager's career. And that's basically it, that really involved uh making that special",23,5.6
"23_segment-06","Okay in this situation uh it involves working at ETS with on boarding readers and raters. We had uh a problem to solve in the sense that we had so many","readers and raters who need to on board in a small amount of time and due to the paperwork that we needed to collect uh it was, there were some issues","with getting our numbers met for certain programs. Uh We talked about trying to make the on boarding process more electronic. We were collecting a lot of","paper mail. Uh We all decided as a group that it would be better if we uh could make what we had on paper electronic. Uh The one piece of paper that was","really important to the hiring process was the I-nine. uh For years they were collecting and doing the I-nine uh in uh paper form so my boss looked at","finding someone to do it electronically and then what I did was I asked if I collaborate with them to develop and design an electronic version of the","I-nine. Uh It presented some problems because the company really was not uh prepared for uh the process of the I-nine, they were more of a electronic","signature company so they were good at writing the technology end of the I-nine uh but I knew and I was good at the actual I-nine process and what needed","to be done. Uh I worked with legal and I worked with my boss and uh by the time I was finished with what I had designed uh I presented that uh to my boss","who presented it to the higher office, and we did manage to get the I-nine out there in electronic form uh and it was through the beginning of this that",23,4.9
"23_segment-07","Okay, as a case manager I worked with uh a group of around six of us that were considered uhcrisis case workers. There was a new girl that applied for one of our","opened positions. I was part of the hiring process so I actually say that she started out as somebody that I did recommend for the position.uh What happened within","two weeks of her working she was not someone that I wanted to keep on to the position. uhWe had a lot of personality issues with her. She was not organized, she was","not on time, uhand I was the senior case manager so I had to come up with a way to sit down with her and explainum that her behaviors were not really benefiting the","group right now and there was a lot of resentment that she was coming in late. umSo I asked if uh she wanted to ride with me for cases for a while and I took her on","and showed her I managed the um system in the community. When we had meetings I made sure the day before that I would remind her the meeting starts promptly at nine","and that we really would need her to be on time. um She pretty much would start out to follow the rules for a while and fall back into her behaviors. So the next step","was I had to bring her in with my supervisor and we had to sit down and talk about her behaviors and uh discuss how we were going to come up with a way to see if we","could help her, uh and she was open to that also for a while. um The end result was she didn't stay in the position. uh There were things going on in her life that","just prevented her uh from being able to carry out her job the way a good case manager needs to carry out her job especially in a crisis situation so I actually ended",23,6.2
"23_segment-08","This situation uh involves working here at ETS uh with on boarding readers and raters. I was put in charge of the I nine process. Uh it seems the group that","was handling the I nines previously uh were not organized in how they filed the I nines uh or track them. So I came up with a spreadsheet and actually uh","tracked and went back into the room, reorganized the whole file room so that all the I nines could be found in one particular place instead of four as it","was previously. Uh it was a lot of work in addition to my other responsibilities which were on boarding and uh bringing on working with international AP","readers. So when the season got busy, the hiring process for AP I still was responsible for tracking all those I nines and cleaning up the I nine room. Uh","when it became overwhelming for me I would go to my supervisor and ask that I could bring on a temp to handle the file work. Uh it was justified, my","supervisor agreed. There was a lot on my plate going on, there was really not much I had to do to convince her except present uh numbers and my time, what I","spent doing my time was all written out for her. She presented it to her higher ups and we were able to bring on temps for a small amount of time. I had to","be particular about the amount of time that we would bring the temps on. The temps would come in, uh I would explain how I'm tracking the I nines uh and","they would do that task for me while I was able to take care of the other duties that were on my plate at the time. Outcome got a great uh sheet for my I",23,5.8
"23_segment-09","Okay, in this situation uh I'm going to describe working in a group here at ETS. It all consisted of all women, six women. uh The leader presents uh tasks","that need to be taken care of. uh everybody has to contribute to make sure we meet our numbers uh within the certain amount of time. uh First, probably my","reaction to the leader ignoring was more probably justified uh ignoring because what usually happened was the group would fight. uh They would present reasons","why they can't any more that what they have to get done. uh They would complain and just spend a lot of time mostly about complaining. I didn't find there was","really mush that I could do except not really complain and listen to what needed to be done. I'd present what I could do to contribute to getting the task","done that the leader who was also our supervisor was requesting. I feel that she was justified in ignoring most of what the input was because it really was","the resistance to change what they're doing, um which seemed normal to me because the bottom line is you had to do it. So uh [maybe her delivery of not","really], she could have been more engaged but that wasn't my call so there wasn't really anything that I could contribute except what I was going to do to","make sure that the task got done in a positive uh manner. In other words if we'd ever got to my turn and the room seemed to be negative, all I just had to put","there was more of a positive uh look on it instead on contributing to the negative spin that everybody else seemed to have. and that was really all I felt",23,3.4
"23_segment-10","In this situation I'm going to describe something that actually happened recently here at ETS. um It involved my listening skills but outside of my direct uh work","group in the sense that I was given a task to request that something be done uh for a new hire that's coming into our group. uh It was something I had not done","before. um I had to teach myself a system to put this request in through ETS ans when I wasn't sure that uh I did it properly I went to someone who I knew had done","this before. I asked if uh I did it correctly and the answer was given to me that yes it was done correctly. I later learned from the people that take my request","that it was not done properly and therefore there was a delay in getting my request handled in the timely manner that I needed it to be done. uh I explained that","it was my first request uh and  that bottom line is we need this done for the new hire that's coming in into the department and is there way that we can expedite","this. uh They did manage to move the request along but did not promise me that the request would be done in the time frame that I needed it to be done so I had to","then explain to my supervisor that the delay in getting this done, uh accomplished, finished, was due to me not presenting the order in the proper way, uh which I","thought was kind of scary at first was having to explain that it was my error supposedly that delayed getting this report done. uh But my supervisor was actually","uh very understanding about that and uh called it a learning experience and true that it really was uh because from now on I would go and check my work with that",23,3.6
"23_segment-11","Okay, this situation I'm going to go back to uh a time as a case worker. I actually referenced uh this job before. Uh One of my responsibilities as a case worker in the","community uh was I was responsible for making sure that people that were just released from mental institutions uh could remain in the community as long as they did not pose","a threat to the community. Uh If they did or I felt that they posed a threat to themselves or somebody else I was supposed to be able to contact a judge and get a hearing","to, they called it three o six them back into the institutions. Uh When I was given this responsibility I actually met with the judge that was assigned to the county and uh","the judge told me that uh she would not be with me, she doesn't believe in uh holding these hearings and that I would just have to recommit them on a three o two back into","the hospital. I wasn't comfortable with that response because it actually was written in uh local law that I would be able to quickly hold a hearing with the judge to","recommit them and I felt they're putting me in a bad position and it posed uh a threat to the community because the three o two somehow was very time consuming. Uh I ended","up putting in writing to protect my group, to protect my community mental health center. Uh I presented my concerns in writing uh to the mental health director for the","county uh stating exactly what the judge had stated to me. Uh Unfortunately it didn't move anywhere but at least uh I presented my concerns to people that I thought could do","something. They didn't do something so really the onus was on them, uh but I did make sure that my community mental health center understood that what we were responsible",23,5.1
"23_segment-12","This situation here that I'm going to touch on has to do uh with the electronic Inine uh creation here at ETS. uh [In writing the electronic Inine], well let me back up","first of all I have to say, I'm really not that technical so for one to think that I'm going to take something technical and explain it um is not really ever going to be","the case in the sense here that I did understand certain uh aspects of writing an electronic Inine. I certainly was not um the electronic uh guru here in writing that,","that part was left to DocuSign who actually did the uh code writing. But I can say that I worked out the glitches and um like most new electronic systems we launched it,","comes back I discover I have an issue with the Inine. uh Electronically I wanted to protect it, there were some information that the authorizer presented. It was seen that","I didn't want them to see. I went and explained that to my director that I'm going to have to revise this uh and she agreed. She didn't really want to know the technical","aspects because she just wanted the problem solved. So there wasn't much I had to do, is just explain what the issue was, and I did. uh I went to DocuSign, worked with","them. I had to explain to them what the issue was um and together we worked out uh an extra added uh protection so that we could hide information that was presented in the","first part of the Inine from the person who was going to sign the second part of the Inine uh with a code. And that actually worked  fairly well. I think now probably the","electronic Inine, I'm not part of that anymore but I know they still use the electronic Inine, the DocuSign and I believe it's actually revised to a point where it's very",23,3.4
"25_segment-01","To be perfectly honest with you, although I have been","here at ETS for forty years, I cannot remember a","single work situation in which I was not the formal","leader but tried to assume a leadership role. And","there haven't been many recent work situations in","which I was the formal leader either. Because","leadership roles are generally is something I've","avoided at every opportunity. Uh My attitude has","typically been to do my job and avoid being","responsible for anybody else doing their job. So I",25,1.4
"25_segment-02","This is really very embarrassing. Because I don't think that I've ever","been in the position of trying to build motivation in my coworkers or","subordinates. In the first place I've never had any subordinates, it's","something I've avoided at every opportunity. And the second place,","building motivation in my coworkers is something I never worried about. My","coworkers have always been highly motivated and I have too. And so we've","always been in a position of trying to work together to get a job done, I","can't think of a single situation where I've been working with somebody","who needed to be motivated. We are all motivated, we are trying to do the","best we can all the time. And uh so I think this question simply doesn't",25,1.4
"25_segment-03","Now this is a very interesting story, it's a story of how I narrowly avoided becoming somebody's supervisor. What happened was my data analyst was","having trouble getting along with her supervisor. And the group head came and asked me if I would be willing to be the Supervisor for my data","analyst. And I said yes I would do it, under one condition. Now at that time we had a performance appraisal system that was based on allocating","points and there were certain number of points that could be allocated and they were a total maximum number of points for the entire stat analysis","units that you couldn't exceed. And so what I said to the group head was here is my condition, Uh If there are not enough rating points to go around","for me to give a data analyst the rating I think she deserves, I can accept. Uh but if somebody tries to uh make me put in negative comments to","justify giving her a lower rating, I won't do that. And if somebody else puts them in, puts the negative comment that I didn't put in, I won't sign","it. And if that's okay then I'm willing to be her Supervisor. And my group head said, Okay well, I'll check with the Director of Stat Analysis. And","a couple of days later he came back to me and he said I'll be her supervisor, meaning he would. So that's how I narrowly escaped becoming somebody's","supervisor. And it's also how I verified my suspicion that there was something going on with those performance ratings, that was not exactly uh on",25,2.9
"25_segment-04","This is another one of those questions that just doesn't apply to my job and the way I do it. I don't try to negotiate with my","coworkers or the people I work with. There is nothing to negotiate we are trying to do the best job we can. The only time that","I've ever been involved in something that really resembled negotiation was the time I was in a meeting with a Program Director","and a Test Developer and I was the statistician at the meeting. And it had to do with uh cost estimation and the Program","Director was one of these people who believes in negotiation. And so the Test Developer was giving him assessments and the","Program Director was trying to talk him into lower numbers. And uh the Test Developer had given him his best estimates. And","finally I said to the uh Program Director, I said, Look he's giving you his best honest guess. First I should explain that the","uh Program Director had said Well I view this as a process of negotiation. And so what I said, at that point I couldn't stay","on the sidelines any longer. So I said Look if he knows that you are going to try to talk him down, he's going to give you an","artificially inflated estimate. So the question is, do you want his best honest estimate, or you want to play games? So uh no",25,2
"25_segment-05","I actually cannot think of the time when I had to bargain or compromise with somebody I was working with, that we'd arrive at a mutually favorable outcome. I can think of sometimes where I would have","liked to have been able to do that, but I couldn't. And I can tell you about one of those, and the outcome wasn't very uh good for me or for ETS. uh And that was the situation where we had to equate","some test scores for which we really needed to have what we call a rescoring sample. Which means getting some papers from a previous administration of a test and having them rescored. And the coworker I","was working with said, There's no time for that and I said, Well then I don't know, we really can't do a good job of equating these tests if we don't have that information. She said, Well there's no","time in the schedule to allow for it. I said, Well I don't know what we can do and she said Well you got one day to decide. And so I came back the next day and decided and I wish if I had one decision","in my career to take or do over again, it would be this one. I said okay we'll do the best we can to equate the scores without that information.    And that's what we tried to do and the result was a","disaster for ETS, probably the greatest disaster in terms of reporting of incorrect scores that ETS has ever had. um Because there was no opportunity to bargain or compromise, and in fact it was not","even any time she would have given me advice. I tried to go to my Group Head for advice, my Group Head was off taking a quality control course. I tried to go to the Director of Stat Analysis, she was","unavailable, she was on a business trip. I tried to go to some experienced colleagues and I couldn't find any of them within the twenty-four hours that I was given to make the decision. And I made the","wrong decision and I've regretted it ever since and regretted it on many times. And so ETS reported a lot of wrong scores, incurred some huge expenses and I was basically the person responsible and I",25,1.8
"25_segment-06","There have been lots of occasions where I have tried to get people to go along with something I was suggesting, when I was suggesting a new way of doing something. And in most cases,","there hasn't been much persuasion required because I'm in a technical area of ETS. And when I come up with a solution, if I present it to people who are technically competent they can","usually see the advantages of it. And typically when they see the advantages of, if they see the advantages of something I'm proposing typically they'll accept it. And there's not a","great deal of persuasion required. [The only time that], uh of course there are some cases where ideas I've suggested haven't uh been accepted and it's a case of not only persuasion not","being required, but it's simply not possible. Because uh well in many cases things I've suggested were not accepted for reasons that had nothing to do with the statistical advantages or","disadvantages of it. Uh I can think especially one meeting I had with the President of ETS, and me and my boss from Statistics and uh ETS's General Council and some people from Test","Development.    And the question was whether or not a certain test should have a single sixty minute, a single forty-five minute essay or three fifteen minute essays. And my boss and I","argued for the fifteen minute essays because it would produce a much more reliable score. The lawyer ETS's General Council agreed with us and the Test Developers uh gave some arguments","which made no sense to me and still doesn't. Something about writing across the curriculum, and to my utter and complete amazement the President of ETS decided to go with the single","forty-five minute essay. Disregarding the advice from both her statisticians and her lawyers, and at that point I began to lose my faith in the judgment of ETS's President. And that",25,3.9
"25_segment-07","I had a coworker that I worked with occasionally, who was difficult. um She wanted lots of collegial discussion and what collegial discussion meant to her was that basically she would argue","with you until you accepted what uh she was saying as being the right answer. And she didn't like to take, she didn't want to, she never wanted to agree to disagree. I mean there's some issues","on which reasonable people can reasonably disagree. um In her mind uh if there was disagreement, that just meant that you hadn't listened to her enough to be persuaded to her point of view.","And meetings with her could go on for a very long time and so what I eventually would do would be to avoid meetings with her. And I would, I'd try to communicate with her either uh in writing","or um sometimes, um if if I directly discussed an issue I'd try to make it at a time when I didn't have much time to spend. Because she would spend literally two hours, now it just happened","that uh  we had a uh a Test Developer working with us who was the kind of person who can't say anything briefly.   And uh he wanted to meet with me about something and I somehow arranged","things so that he could meet with her. I thought this would be fun and uh so they had the meeting. And I found out the next day that their meeting had lasted for two hours, and it's only","because their the the work day was over that they finally agreed to stop. But uh in general uh I dealt with the situation by,uh I would say Okay we'll have to agree to disagree and if she she","wouldn't accept it I would make myself unavailable. uh And we succeeded in working together fairly smoothly most of the time, and when there was a case when we didn't simply agree um then uh I","would simply withdraw from the discussion. Because I didn't have infinite amount of time to spend trying to convince her to my point of view. And uh if I found hers unconvincing I wasn't",25,3.1
"25_segment-08","I can't really think of a time when I felt as if I was being given more than my share of the boring tedious tasks that have to be done. And","there are tasks like that involving Stat Analysis, and uh we all do them, we all know that they have to be done and we pitch in and we do our","share. And I never really felt as if I was being asked to do more than my share. uh However there have been times when I would read in the uh","ETS uh internal website about interesting projects that were going on. And I would think 'there is a lot of interesting work going on in this","company and I'm not doing any of it.' And at that point, I finally decided to apply for a job in another area of ETS and of course I went and I","had the job interview. um And this must have been about fifteen years ago I guess. um I interviewed for the job and I waited because things","happen slowly in ETS. I waited and I waited, and meanwhile I continued to do my job and eventually I got some interesting work. And by the time","uh they were ready to make a decision on this position I had a applied for, somebody called me and asked me was I was still interested. And by","that time I had gotten two interesting projects to work on, so I said no. But I can't honestly say there's a time when I felt like I had been","assigned more than my share of the uh unpleasant tasks. um It just hasn't happened, I've been assigned my share, I've done it. You have to pitch",25,3.8
"25_segment-09","I hate to disappoint you but I cannot honestly think of a time when someone","took over the leadership of a group project I was involved with and ignored","the contributions that weren't in accordance with his or her own opinion. I","can't even think of a time when somebody took over the leadership of a","group project who wasn't supposed to be the leader. Uh Typically when","there's a group there is a person who is the leader. Uh And so I can't even","think of a case where I've had to work with a leader who just ignored the","contributions that weren't in accordance with his or her own opinion in the","case of a group project. I just can't think of any occurrence, uh I've been","at ETS forty years uh maybe I've been unusually lucky but I have not had",25,2.3
"25_segment-10","I'm sure there had been times when I did have to use my listening skills to overcome a communication problem at work. But I'm having trouble thinking of a single specific case when I had to do","that. I know that I'm often asked to translate uh technical uh concepts into language that non-technical people can understand. And when you do that, if you're interacting with them face to","face you know in real time. Then you have to listen to what they're saying so that you can see what it is that they don't understand. And I do this all the time when I'm consulting with people","who come to me with statistical questions. I have to listened, inferring the first place you have to listen to hear what they're really asking. [Because sometimes what they think they're","asking isn't what they really, isn't] They'll ask you a question, and sometimes the question isn't exactly what they need to know. And by listening carefully and asking the right questions and","response, you can find out what the problem really is. And sometimes what the problem really is, is not what they think it is. Uh    And that happens very often when people ask you technical","questions. Uh So I do have to use my listening skills there. Another way I have to use my listening skills is that uh a large number probably the majority of my younger colleagues are not","native English speakers. And their English is quite good considering that they're not native speakers but still uh sometimes they have difficulties. But uh more commonly it's not a question of","limited English skills, it's a question of the perception of the problem. Sometimes their perception of the problem isn't what the problem really is and so you have to ask probing questions to","find out what it is they're trying to accomplish. And then you realize uh that the answer to the question that they really need answered is not necessary the answer to the question they",25,5.7
"25_segment-11","Without a doubt the most difficult information that I have ever had to communicate to my Supervisor was the information that we had recorded a large number of scores that were","incorrect. They were incorrect because we had done a statistical operation in a way that wasn't the best way we could have done it. And that I was the person responsible and what I","did was to explain what had happened, how we had gotten into the situation that we were in. And what I was doing to get us out of it. And first of all how I discovered that we have","this problem, because we didn't realize originally that the scores, that there was any problems with the scores. But when I investigated, I questioned about it and discovered much to","my shock that we had, that's when I discovered that we had recorded a lot of wrong scores. And then I had to explain how it had happened, and uh it was a rather complicated technical","explanation step by step. There were a number of steps that which we could have avoided but didn't, I could think of three ways that we could have avoided the problem but we didn't.","And I had to explain how I discovered the problem, how I established that there was a problem. And I had to explain um how the problem occurred, what we had done that had caused the","problem to occur and what we could do to rectify the situation. And in this decision when I think all the way up to the President of the ETS, who decided that we would rectify the","situation by sparing no expense and redoing all the scores and getting it right to the extent that it was possible. And then I directed the effort to do it right, the way I really","wished I had insisted on doing it from the beginning. And the outcome was that we corrected all the incorrect scores but we still got sued and wound up paying millions. Literally",25,6.3
"25_segment-12","You asked me to explain to you about a time when I had to explain a complex or technical idea to a non-technical or unfamiliar audience. Well it's difficult to pick a single time because I do this all the time, it's","one of the major parts of my job. Uh I give classes to new ETS employees, uh some of them in a technical position, but some them not. I give classes of item analysis, uh equating, I do a class called 'scores and","score scales,' I give a class on reliability and validity. And I study a great deal of time, uh first of all deciding what it is that the people I'm going to be talk to need to know about this particular subject.","Because if you're talking to a group of people, who are going to work in stat analysis. What they need to know is not necessarily the same thing uh that people who are going to be working in test development need to","know. There will be a large amount overlap but it won't be exactly the same. And what they bring to the uh class before they come in, also varies tremendously, so there's a wide range of background knowledge in","addition.    And I have to figure out what it is that people really need to know and then I have to figure out ways to explain it uh so that they can understand it easily. One thing I've found is that you don't","throw formulas at people because uh I know I can't learn way and I don't think many people can. You can't throw a bunch of formulas up on the screen, that simply doesn't hold.

"26_segment-01","During one of our team meetings","someone started speaking and","they got off track. So I","proceeded to say, to agree with","what they were saying and then","I continued to say Okay and now","I'm moving forward, let's","continue, let's get back on the","subject. And we ultimately","ended our meeting in time,",26,3.3
"26_segment-02","Once again this was at a team meeting, and it was very","recent because I had just celebrated being here for twenty","five years. I said it was a great company to work for and","they were, seemed pretty excited that they were all working","here at ETS. And I also brought some cupcakes but that was","also in celebration of our supervisor's birthday. Actually","we all pitched in there, I brought the cupcakes, others","brought like the paper goods uh and there's only five of","us, so it's a nice small group. And we all talked about","anything and everything except for work. So it was a very",26,3.5
"26_segment-03","See there was time when I was in a group where there were two","consultants and they did not work well together. One of them felt as","though they were doing more work than the other one was doing. And to","be perfectly honest I sort of, of course did not take sides but I also","did not try to convince one, you know that they really should like the","other one. And I think that's what it was, it was more of a personality","clash as opposed to their work. They were both good workers, uh one was","more detailed than the other and I think they felt as though they were","doing more work. um At least that was in the past unfortunately neither","one of them, um they're still here. So I really didn't try to change",26,2.3
"26_segment-04","Probably the most recent thing that comes to mind is well, helping someone work on a project of","theirs. I felt that there could be more efficient ways of doing that project. So I said I had some","suggestions that they could look at or listen to and maybe you know we can, the work can be done","without a lot of additional help. And I said Let me just show you what I think that can be done, and","here's one thing I think that could be streamlined. And they actually said Yes I think you are right.","And I had inquired as to why it was being done you know that way and the response was because that's","the way it's always been done, evidently for thirty years. So we did try it um in a little more","streamlined way and there were other ways that it could have also been done more efficiently. But I","certainly was not going to try to take it over, which I wouldn't want to do anyway. And so as of this","day things are, a couple of things are being done more efficiently um at my suggestion and so far",26,4.4
"26_segment-05","I think the answer to this is also the","previous uh response to question number four.","Uh once again by assisting someone with their","project, I found some more efficient ways,","certain small details could be performed but","with less effort. Yet the outcome would be","the same, which is the outcome that they","wanted. Actually I wouldn't say this was an","actual bargain or a compromise. It was just","working with others and giving them the",26,2.6
"26_segment-06","There was a time again I was helping to work on a group's project","and there was a lot of paper involved. I suggested that these be","sent to, it was actually committee members by way of emails because","they all had an email address. um This wound being accepted as a","good idea, I said and instead of keeping paper copies this could all","be kept electronically. And one of the group members agreed, one","that I was helping her with, that it could be kept electronically.","And the communications with committee members could also be","electronic and they were sent by way of emails. And certain","documents as attachments to those emails. And now they are all kept",26,4.1
"26_segment-07","This hasn't happened too often in my work experience, but","unfortunately being at the level that I am at I have to interact","with people uh with respect. And I may not like these people but","I will respect the positions that they hold. So I will interact","with them strictly on a business level and will complete the","work that I've been asked to do and how I've been asked to do","it. And therefore I will interact with these, interacted with","that person on a professional level. There's not too much I can","do or certainly I cannot change anything but I will do what is","expected of me. And actually continue to do so with this",26,4.5
"26_segment-08","Being an admin professional or a professional admin, I am asked to multi-tasks and through different","applications. There was a time when uh there were three, four admins and they all found other positions and I","was left to support approximately ninty people and this was for about a year. Then I was, I said You know I","really do need some help. And at the time they did hire uh a temp to be my back up, unfortunately that person","was being monopolized by a group, a small group of people with their work. So once again, I was uh supporting","admin work for about ninty people. Then unfortunately I took ill suddenly so they hired someone and that was","a very big help to me. And they did realize once I was unable, once I was out they realized that I did a lot","and did need help. So when I came back, after being out uh there was someone who was hired and who had","actually, was familiar with ETS policies and procedures. So that was definitely a big help, it wasn't like I","had to train someone. So we got along great, that person is no longer here but I always, since then I've been",26,5.2
"26_segment-10","I would say every time that there is a","group or team meeting, uh I always have","to use my listening skills. Mainly","because there may be certain items","brought up that I do not particularly","agree with. However I do realize that","that's the way things are going to be","and so I do listen and well at times","still use my own professional ideas and","work style to, for the outcome to still",26,3.9
"26_segment-11","See there was a time when I was asked to give feedback on some temps that","were hired. um One in particular and I did give feedback, it was critical","feedback that was positive as well as um not so positive. And I was honest.","The outcome was that the person was still given work to do and but evidently","she was being watched as well. And eventually it was felt that it was not a","good fit and someone else was eventually hired. This person actually felt","that and heard that and her exact words were, 'the jobs that she was given to","do were not what she was um expecting, was not what she was signed up to do.'","So she eventually did leave as well, she was let go. But actually I found out","recently that she found another job, a permanent job not as a temp. So I was",26,4.5
"26_segment-12","I was actually never put into a position where I had","to explain a complex or technical idea to a non-","technical or unfamiliar audience. I've actually had","very technical people who have explained ideas to me","that were above my technical experience or knowledge.","So I've actually been on the other end, I've actually","learned I was actually I would say one of them is non-","technical or unfamiliar audience participants. And","I've learned a lot by people who are very technical","familiar, very technical knowledgeable and have",26,2.2
"27_segment-01","I had uh been assigned to uh prepare a uh white paper and I believe a PowerPoint presentation for uh, presentation for the Board of Trustees, this","was last year. And uh I was uh, my duty, was responsible for gathering all the information for different uh presenters on different products and uh","services, different uh areas and lines of business uh throughout the company. So it was uh a lot of information in different places, different types","of information. uh And uh I wasn't the leader of the uh entire project but uh I was uh responsible for gathering of the data, organizing it and uh","putting it into a narrative, a clear narrative, a clear and colorful narrative presentation for uh top officers. And uh what I did to uh follow","through with that was uh just to take the responsibility on myself not to ask anybody else to prove, uh see if they could get me, uh speak to","somebody else to get at the data, reach out to specific uh Directors, Executive Directors and Vice Presidents. To gather the information that I","thought I needed, including uh charts and statistics but also uh marketing plans and uh uh business analysis.

"27_segment-02","This is a little uh uh tricky I suppose, uh I tend to work on my own, not in teams very much. But uh I do, uh uh as a writer uh people give me","assignments, um pump your hair for clients so as the middle person, the client, the the project person and me. So I would get an assignment from the","project person but uh they often uh don't have the same feel for the kind of information I would need to do the writing, which is understandable it's not","their expertise. Uh so in one instance uh I was given an assignment and it's often very spare specifications, again very understandable. Uh and I have","this impression that they're very busy people, the Project Managers and I think they are. And I try not to load them up or uh drown them in questions","about uh 'I need this, I need that, I need the other thing.' Um but there is, there are times when uh it would be helpful to have some other information","and to go through them, because uh it's often appropriate way to work to not go around people but to go work with them.    And this whole particular","assignment, it was not a big assignment but uh I needed some information on the ETS Cares plan Campaign. Um and I wanted some information that would help","me approach the writing or the story from a different angle and uh I could have done the assignment without it, but I explained uh fairly briefly, put an","email to the project person, [How I], what information would be helpful if she can get that would be great, and uh I think by just being nice about it I",27,3.2
"27_segment-03","Don't have a specific instance that I can recall in which there were two people uh in a group uh who did not work well together, people","usually try to uh accommodate comprise with one another. um People tend to be pretty mature about that. um However on daily assignments","um people tend to get overloaded with uh a lot of work, you know the work ebbs and flows and when it slows, I also get those two","confused. When it flows people can get a little stressed uh with each other on different sides of the project, but um it's easy to get","drawn into it because people complain to you about somebody else. um But uh it's a dangerous um path to go down to get into uh","supporting the arguments or getting involved in the arguments and bad mouthing somebody else. So I guess it's just a question of um","being understanding without being uh, without agreeing with somebody, understanding about somebody's position and how uh stressed they","are without jumping onto the bandwagon about how it's somebody else's fault, because it's always everybody's fault, it's my fault, it's","your fault, everybody has some fault or where everybody has the same stresses. So the way that I try to get around that or to deal with","that is to be uh empathetic I guess, and to uh listen and uh roll my eyes about my own stresses. And uh people seem to be uh willing to",27,4.7
"27_segment-04","uh I don't recall a specific instance of trying to gain someone's trust while negotiating with him but um it is often, it often has","happened in my job uh where I will be speaking with someone about um an article that I'm writing or speech or presentation and uh they","may not be very comfortable with uh speaking to me or having their work discussed that way. Or more likely, more often is um they want","to present the story, uh a particular aspect of the story, and as it happens people here are involved in pretty highly technical work.","But uh my, the communications that I write, uh the audiences uh that I write for are non technical people and uh for communication to","be effective and meaningful to a non technical audience, it has to be accessible, and it can't be written in a lot jargon and narrow","angles.

But in the writing of it, um give a little bit of everybody's side of the story, something that's on the technical","material, um but introduce the story in a more lay approach that's going to be uh more accessible and have a broader appeal to uh non",27,5
"27_segment-05","This is such a common occurrence in my work that it's hard to pick out a specific instance. But um I as a writer, a writer of uh the communication but it's not my","communication. uh For instance uh in office where I could be writing uh either a speech or um a white paper written uh or a letter even. And uh this is a large","organization and uh one project could involve people from different parts of the company. And everybody who is involved in the project has a stake in the outcome of","the project but also in the communication and uh they should have a voice and everything else, have a voice in the communication. And uh I as  professional writer I","think I um know how it should read I think that my style would be the best, But um like I said everybody thinks that way. But uh the fact is it's not my","communication, it's somebody else's or it's other people's and they have, uh let's just say a legitimate interests but they have, uh within their every right to","expect to get their voice represented in the communication.   So I try to uhmanage my edits, so and suggestions so that they are not overwhelming or uh stamp out","somebody else's voice or view or uh uh interest, and accommodate everybody.

I don't know if anybody would ever be able to detect it but um I'm assuming that um the final product satisfies, everyone and meets their needs and they're",27,5.7
"27_segment-06","Uh I can recall an instance in which uh uh I was preparing, I was assigned to write a uh white paper again of the Board of Trustees, uh on behalf of","different areas of the company. And uh there was uh an interest uh among uh some people in having, in addition to a white paper, also having an","executive summary of it as well as a PowerPoint presentation. Uh As I got deeper into the project, the assignment, uh it became clear that there's is","only so much time to get the material, the assignment done uh and there would probably be time for an executive summary. [Besides the], or even more","importantly the executive summary as I kind of started in on it would have uh been very repetitive because it wasn't that long a white paper, twenty or","thirty pages I guess, if that much. Uh And a white paper or executive summary to a short paper, it has to get redundant and uh not to add much value.","And it was really just a question of uh pointing that out and uh to my supervisor and saying, I've started on this and it's pretty clear that it's just","going to be a lot of extra verbiage, and a lot of repetitive material. So maybe if it's not necessary, he'll remove the executive summary, we'll have","an introduction. Which uh every white paper would have anyway, but the introduction serves the same purpose as an executive summary. If you can only","read a couple of pages of a white paper, the introduction should tell you everything that an executive summary would and uh that's how uh we approached",27,4.6
"27_segment-07","I worked at several newspapers and uh uh there's always one or two editors who are difficult people, um","there's many that are great. But um in one uh job I recall an editor uh who's an an attorney, he's on a","legal publication, he's a lawyer by training, came to journalism through that. They really didn't have","that great a feel for um investigative journalism type of approach. And uh w-w- he would often insert","very legalesey jargony type of language into a news article um and it just doesn't it just doesn't","work. It reads very inconvenient and very, sound very stilted. uh But I have found uh that when I, I","had found in those jobs and when I approached the article in a way that was most comfortable for me, as","the reporter on it um it would work best that way and there wouldn't be a lot of argument or any","argument um. If If something isn't written in a certain way then certain languages, it's it's it's","going to be obvious that it doesn't fit. Try not to get into arguments though with supervisors, it's",27,3.2
"27_segment-08","Very rarely in any job I guess felt that I was given an unfair share of unpleasant tasks. I guess every job has it's share of unpleasant or","boring tasks, uh so I've never really felt singled out that way and there are jobs or assignments that I don't enjoy doing and I dread getting.","Uh When I was a newspaper reporter I would dread a lot of obituaries and call on a police departments and various, you know couple of counties","and ask them if they had any news for the day, there was a lot of accidents and some things like that. Uh It's drudgery, it's boring, uh","unpleasant, especially if people don't really want to hear from you. Uh At another newspaper job uh it would often happened that a court","decision would come down late in the week in the uh deadline cycle. And of course it would be a seventy-five page opinion on insurance for","Appeals Court which is about as mind crushing and denting is possible but, it's got to go to somebody, somebody has to write it, uh which means","somebody has to read it. But uh oddly enough even that could be interesting uh reading that reasoning or research material here sometimes. It's","not the topic that I would gravitate to but the more you read about something the more interesting and the more engrossed you can get in it.","And uh that's just a part of the job and I can complain about assignments but uh never that I get more than my fair share of boring one, it's",27,4.9
"27_segment-09","I really don't have any, I don't recall any instance in which someone took over the leadership of a project and ignored the","contributions that were not in accordance with his or her own opinion. um People have come and gone with projects and people","uh on projects uh often have different views. um If, uh it's I guess in those situations I need to remember, I try to","remember that uh ah it's usually not my, it's not my communication here, I'm working for someone else, they have a right to","their voice, everybody has a right to be heard. um And uh the trick in a work setting, I guess in any other social setting","too is being able to recognize or distinguish between what's important to you as for your ego. uh Why you would be holding","on to a position is it for ego, is it fear or uh is it a genuinely held position? It's not easy to do but um I think it's a","helpful approach in trying to manage teams, people on teams or your own, my own role in a team. My job I'm very often, left","alone. I uh don't work in teams very often I work for groups of people with different uh uh constituencies, they call,","there's other communication but uh I'm pretty much left to do the work on my own, with other people's input. But um it's how",27,3.5
"27_segment-10","I can give this an instance, a recent instance um and uh of listening skills, I'd define it a little differently than listening with my","ears. um As a writer, I write something, a draft and it will be circulated among different stakeholders and they will respond, ah usually","on the draft. And so different notes and suggestions and then just come back on the draft and some people are better than others at","knowing not just what to say but how to say it, in a way that's not going to antagonize work that's not going to antagonize me. um Very","recently I got uh some uh edits or suggestions, edits really, comments on uh communication that it did press my buttons. Not because,","necessarily because of the substance although I had some dispute with that, but um the form and how it was said, style and that it really","bothered me. um The listening part entails reading or hearing or understanding the substance of the editor or the feedback ah separate","from the tone or style of it, we'll not always agree to that. ah I've gotten more mindful about it and much better under the years but","sometimes you know under a pressure situation, um it can really just be quite annoying. I can't say I um did not respond to that person","directly, I did to my supervisors and uh in a way that there was a substance of it. In a way that produced substantive responses and a",27,4
"27_segment-11","[In] I haven't really had any occasion I can recall to uh be critical of my supervisor, I'm very fortunate in  having pretty good supervisors. Uh but uh the","nature of my work 'editing' is uh criticism is kind of inherent in it, if somebody used me to draft, they've written and wanted, and they want it edited, I'm","going to edit and I can be an aggressive editor. Uh this happens almost everyday uh and the way that I approach that is we use the track changes. And if we","ever had a draft that's marked up with a lot of track changes, you open it up it looks like it's been painted red and it can be pretty unsettling and jawing","and pretty annoying. Uh but I try to limit my edits to what I think is most important, most substantive but also what's going to improve the readability of","it. Uh and certainly [not] to explain when I think explanations are necessary, uh not to just rewrite it but also it was very important to provide that person","the writer, with two versions.    Say a version showing the edits or the track changes which you can induce a heart attack, when you open it up. And one","showing with the edits accepted, it's a clean version so uh it's much easier to read without the distractions of the edits and without the kind of emotional","content of seeing all the uh edits. And I find that, I think it seems to help uh because it's easy to read and you can see the uh improvements or things that","you don't want to accept, if you're the uh uh client I guess. And it's also important to tell people that, to make the point that these are suggestions uh",27,5.1
"27_segment-12","Translating complex and technical material to non technical uh audiences, that's everyday on my job. I'm the uh go-between between uh","technical people who are creating projects or conducting research uh and readers who uh are not familiar at all with their material, are not","familiar with the language and nomenclature. um And uh often I'm the one who's not familiar with it, but um I did my best to learn about the","uh material, so I have a grasp of it. And sometimes that involves speaking with a technical person or sometimes it just means uh reading","about it. And uh my responsibility is to reduce it to its most interesting, meaningful and accessible uh language and presentation um while","fairly and accurately fully representing the uh, whatever is innovative, unique or um and very unique about the product. um Every, almost","every script I write for an all staff meeting uh will uh try to explain a new product or a new assessment uh in uh very brief terms, there's","not a lot of time to explain it. And uh to use as little jargon and as few acronyms as possible. It's easy to do when you're writer, to","identify with the technical people because you learn about an issue and you get comfortable with uh acronyms, it's a way to speak to the","technical people. But uh when you're writing it you will need to know how to translate that for, so it will be a meaningful communication to",27,4.3
"28_segment-01","Well uh we have, actually have a current work situation, in which this question perfectly describes what I'm trying to do. uh The","background of this situation is uh for several years I've been the person who is in charge of distributing the proper amount of tape","recorders and headsets and assorted gear that we need at the AP reading, in the second session of Cincinnati two. uh At Cincinnati two","we do the uh subjects that require uh tapes, music and the four languages, Spanish, French, German and Italian. I have, was told that","I'm going to now move on to some other projects and Praxis not AP. And we're transitioning, another person is basically now going to","be the leader or is going to be responsible for all of this. Here's what I've tried to do, basically I show him what to do and he","shadows what I do. So my behavior is to, without being overbearing about it, suggest certain ways to do this um and since I'm still","going to be using these in Cincinnati two I am packing my own parachute. So I demonstrate how we get the pilots, how we unpack them,","test everything and then redistribute the equipment according to the various subjects needs. Spanish is the largest, they get the","most, they got the most varied. And right now it's going along quite smoothly and we're moving at nice clip so I'm hoping that will",28,5.7
"28_segment-02","This is a tougher question, because I don't have, uh subordinates, Uh I am what I call a utility in fielder or a grunt uh when it","comes to working everything that is, I know a little about everything, but not a lot about just one thing. Uh for me to build","motivation in co workers, uh this would have to be an everyday situation in what I do at work and that is again providing modeling","through my behavior, to other people, to my co workers. I fill pre work work on time, I'm there all the time, I ask the questions","that need to be asked, I'm not afraid of asking for help, or by my actions telling somebody that they know more than I do. And then","I'm also willing to learn and then work with that person to get a particular task and, so again as I responded earlier, my behavior","is to act uh responsibly, uh whole heartedly and openly, and by providing this example, get people also to, to work with me and if","that comes close to building motivation then yes this is what I do. But as a general rule like I said I am not in any type of boss","position. Uh and I don't like giving people orders per se because I never fell into the habit of, I'd rather show them what to do","through example than actually say, okay this is what I want you to do. I do it and show them what needs to be done, and hopefully",28,4.8
"28_segment-03","This is more theoretical because I can't recall off the top of my head any time I did this. Uh I do work with people who obviously don't","work well together sometimes, uh occasionally I don't particularly feel like working well together with me. Uh what I do in that","situation is basically I accept blame, I have a self deprecating sense of humor, I will be the one who if something goes wrong and they","are just ready to blame anybody, I'll accept the blame. [It's really hard] what I've discovered is when people expect you to fight back","and you don't, this is very disconcerting to them and they have to, it forces them into the position of being the nicer guy. I mean this","is the guy who has just confessed to being an idiot, Oh jeez it was my fault, uh um I'm really sorry how do you suggest we do this? You","give them the feeling of responsibility, of accomplishment and you, they unwittingly become your ally. You do this not by conflict, you","do this not by saying, Well I'm the boss and this is what you're going to do. Uh I modify my own behavior in the hope that this puts them","in a different mode. They don't have to like me, but it's really hard when somebody has told you know that more than he does, to be mad","at. Because this is what you think of yourself anyway, in that position. And again generally, these are short term things, they work out.",28,3.4
"28_segment-04","I remember a time, it was working at an AP reading in Kentucky. And I was new and I was trying to fit in, uh working with and trying to gain","trust. So I could ask these people, what needed to be done, to negotiate with them, to find out uh where I could fit in best with the group and","how we could work well together. Uh one of the ways I did that was through establishing common ground through conversations, general probing,","find out what you have in common and build on that. In fact not only what the two of you have in common, but what that person and the other","person across the room has in common. And talk to that person and mention that people love to talk about their common interests, it just breaks","down so many barriers that way it's an informal way for doing it, but like I said I generally work through an informal method. So you talk to","people, you listen to them, you find out what's in common and you also bring that commonality to somebody else and you create a bridge between","those people and a third and yourself. And suddenly you have a group that is gently surprised with uh what they have in common with the other","people. Working from that background, then you can move into the business aspects, and then it becomes a little bit more formalized, but people","are then more ready to share, more ready to be open, more ready for a more harmonious outcome, in the workplace. And in Kentucky we got the job",28,6.1
"28_segment-05","Well recently uh a colleague and I were asked to come up with a PowerPoint presentation uh for a Praxis meeting. The subject was","how best to use small groups of scores to work more effectively uh on prompts by splitting them up into teams. So instead of","having the traditional one group goes into calibration then into scoring, then goes to another question, is to split it up so","that you would have two groups concurrently in two different, uh or even three different prompt. Eliminating the waiting time","and then showing how this saves you time and money, she didn't want to do. uh We were told to do this and she just, she says I","know what to do, but I don't know how to explain it, I really, I don't want to do it. Uh So what I did this is bargaining, this","compromising was okay, I said, You're the expert in the actual process, but I know PowerPoint, I know editing and I know","presentation, so we'll split it up to fit our mutual strengths. Uh This led to her saying, Okay and just giving me just a bunch","of notes to work with. And I did a little interviewing as well, put it into a PowerPoint presentation, it had sixteen","iterations, she liked it and she actually was the one who, she liked it so much it was so much comfortable, she ended up doing",28,6.3
"29_segment-01","I create metrics documentation that my team uses to record","our progress uh week by week, month by month and so on.","Unfortunately a couple of my peers aren't very good at","keeping up with their documentation and their recording.","My supervisor has asked me to work with them in a quasi","supervisal position to guide them and mentor them in","improving their skills.

"29_segment-03","When I was teaching I had two classroom assistants who","didn't get along with each other well. And what I tried to","do the most was assign them things to do within the","classroom where they weren't interacting. Assign somebody","to work with a group of students and somebody else to work","with papers or things along those lines. I did talk to","both of them separately and tried to work with them that","way and uh the outcome was mixed. They attempted to work","together, uh clearly didn't get along but were able to","perform what they needed to perform during the day uh",29,4.5
"29_segment-04","Well I think my initial job interview for this position was a negotiation, and that's the time","that you're trying to gain trust. um What I tend to do that I think works well in these","situations or in situations with coworkers where you are given a project and you may not know","the person well or may not get along with them well if you do is try to personalize things, to","find something that you have in common that you can talk about, whether it's work related or","outside of work but by personalizing your situation and finding things that are in common it","tends to put them at ease and uh lighten up the situation. And they do tend to open up to you a","bit more, um especially asking people questions about themselves and their interests and giving","them an opportunity to speak and you listen. That usually provides a positive outcome and yields","the results that at least I would want um in that type of situation. And I tend to be successful",29,5.4
"29_segment-05","Well bargaining is a big part of what I do in my position. I'm a liaison between the IT department and the office","of quality um working on documentation and many people have other things, deadlines they need to do and don't","consider this the most important or top priority for their uh day to day work. However, the office of quality sees","it differently and expects things in a timely manner and it's my job to work between the two sides and help move","things along. So many times what I'll do with document owners and people that have things they need to move with","and the tool is I will lay everything out for them and offer to do as much as the lab work for them as possible. I","do the formatting of their documents and create cover pages and the things I need to do to make life easy for them","so that they can do as minimal amount of work towards this as possible and not interrupt their regular work as","much as possible. The outcome turns to be extremely favorable. People appreciate my willingness to help them and","to make things easier for them and it gets me very positive results with getting things accomplished in a timely",29,5.9
"29_segment-06","Well this situation just came up recently, I've been working for the past two years or so with somebody at a monthly report who's a bit","difficult to work with. In that uh they are not very good at following through on their data. Things are often incorrect or late and so","what I wanted to do was create a share point site where everything was centralized and visible to all parties to hold the person a bit","more accountable and to avoid or reduce the uh volume of email stack and forth then having to go back and search for things. So the","person was a bit resistant to it and we had a meeting with the two of us, with their supervisor and some other stakeholders that were","involved in the process. We talked about what the goal was, what my vision was and how it would improve things. And after some discussion","and a bit of objection from this person I was able to create the site. We've just launched it so it's been too soon to say what the exact","outcome is. But it looks like it's an improvement, it looks like it'll make things better and clear. I was able to send the um updated","report out to this person and to a director that the report ultimately is done for and give them each a list of the action items they","needed to respond to and it was all in one place whether that's in screen shots and links and uh other emails. So I think it's going to",29,5.3
"29_segment-07","Well this question piggy backs right on the last one uh to the same person and over the last couple of years we've had a","difficult time working together. She is often uh late with responding, her data is incomplete or incorrect and I spend a lot of","time going back and looking for the correct information, making updates, going back and asking her to make updates and she gets","extremely defensive and argumentative about having to go back and redo her work. So we started out having a meeting with her","manager and another manager in the group and uh it was semi-successful for a short time and then things reverted back to what","they were. Her manager had suggested that I copy her on emails and that improved the situation greatly. I was getting immediate","responses, things were done accurately, and that was wonderful while it was going on. As soon as that stopped things went right","back to the way they were. And so as I said in the previous question we recently met and my suggestion was to create the share","point site to cut down on some of the back and forth of emails and create more visibility across the board for all parties that","are involved and so on. And I do think that this is going to be a positive outcome and a big improvement on what the situation",29,5.5
"29_segment-08","Well I can't think of any particularly unpleasant tasks, tedious, boring, or demanding that I've","been asked to do um that's more than my share. I think sometimes I'm asked to do more than my","share of documentation as far as in our lead capacity when I'm not officially a lead and that can","be a little bit tedious. Having to update templates for the team um over and over again and if","things like that when I've got other work that needs to get done that has deadlines that can be a","little bit overwhelming. Basically the work needs to get done whether I'm happy with it or I agree","with it or not so I've done. And I'm lucky enough that I report to somebody that I can speak","frankly to. So basically I just vent, I'm a venter and I've explained how I felt and we've talked","about it and it's just one of those situations things come up that you don't necessarily like","everything you do. But that's what you are there for and that's what you have to do so you get it",29,4.7
"29_segment-09","About a year or so ago I was in a root cause analysis training analysis training and","we were put into groups. They were assigned so it wasn't a group of people that I","would have necessarily chosen for myself. And we did have somebody that saw","themselves as the group leader and the expert who tended to take over the projects","and answer the questions for the group without necessarily including everybody's","opinion. um What I tried to do was interject my opinion as much as possible within","the group to get answers that were included before the end of the project. If I","wasn't successful in that, sometimes I was, sometimes I wasn't. So if I wasn't","successful in that then I did my best to answer questions individually as they were","asked of people in the group. To make sure that my thoughts were recognized as uh",29,4.7
"29_segment-10","Well there's a couple of different types of communication problems that come into play with my role. One is that I deal with people","from other countries that have very strong accents and many times it's hard to understand them. I did have a situation with one in","particular that the accent was so strong and after asking him to repeat something several times to the point that it would have become","annoying to him for me to continue to ask, I had to ask him to send me his requests in email because I was not able to understand. Once","he sent things to me in email I was able to understand what he was asking and take care of his needs without any other problems. The","other type of communication problem that comes into play is working with somebody where you may hear things differently. Somebody can","tell you something and one person hears one thing and somebody else hears another, and I find if I run into something like that the","best thing to do is to talk to the parties involved and relate what I think I heard or what I think I was told and confirm from them","that that is in fact what I heard or that it wasn't and they can correct me and we can move on from that situation. And that's usually","the best way to handle communication problems. If you just make assumptions and you don't say anything that can lead to bigger problems",29,6.6
"29_segment-11","Well this has happened a couple of times and as I said earlier, I'm lucky enough that I'm able to speak frankly","to my supervisor and so when something has happened that I felt was inappropriate or not the right way to handle","something I'm able to go to her and just tell her frankly I didn't feel that was appropriate for that time or I","didn't like whatever the situation was and we'll talk about what was going on at that point and time, what her","thoughts were, why something happened. If necessary she'll apologize and we'll move on from it. Uh recently we","had a larger incident that I felt was more serious and so I sent an email to her and a copied her manager and","laid out exactly what happened and how I felt about it. And we scheduled a meeting for the three of us to get","together and sit and talk about things and it was extremely productive. We cleared the air about many issues and","talked about some future goals and the outcome was extremely positive. We've got a very open, honest, favorable","relationship and I felt that it was necessary and if I hadn't done things the way that I did them things might be",29,6
"29_segment-12","Well I was working on my green belt, my higher supervisor asked me to give a presentation to our team","about my project and how it was progressing and some other things related to the project. Many of the","people in my group have not had Six Sigma training and aren't familiar with the tools or the charts or","the language. And so when I gave the presentation I wanted to ensure that they were understanding what","I was explaining and what I did is I broke things down into more plain English or if I had to use","jargon I gave the definition and explained what I was talking about as I went along to make the","controlled charts and other things they were looking at easy to understand and more relatable to what","they are doing and not at a higher removed level from them. The outcome was extremely positive, I had","many people thank me for speaking in English as they put it and making that presentation interesting","and understandable. And so that they could follow what I was talking about and I appreciated that",29,5.5
"30_segment-01","Um recently there was an issue in SWS HR where uh when on boarding new hires we had to manually input their new hire information into the system and","uh there were a lot of errors. And they wanted to get it down to zero errors. Uh there's a couple of us that sat on the front line, so we were all","responsible and charged with the task of uh manually entering the new hire information. So that means that the errors could be have been spread","amongst all of us, uh but because they wanted zero errors I underwent the task of uh making some suggestions. I even went to the extent of uh taking","the statement class to help me be able to analyze the information, uh to get into a solution, a solid solution on how to eliminate the errors. Uh","During that time we also went through a phase where there was a new program um a revamped new hire program where the new hire actually inputed their","own information. Um so they kind of skewed the data points and I had to reposition, um reanalyze the data to get to another solution or to see if","that was the solution for the problem. And we had a couple of meetings, I actually led a couple of meetings to get people's take or feel why they","would be making errors versus why the new hires would be making an error. It turned out that we significantly reduced the amount of errors uh and so","at this point right now all I have to do is the final part of my uh Six Sigma projects go ahead and be certified, but that the problem was resolved",30,5.3
"30_segment-02","Well I actually don't have any subordinates, uh never have and actually I don't want any, um","I'm individual contributor so it kind of works out pretty well. Uh Motivating coworkers is","something that I think that everybody needs motivation. And a lot of times uh we're all","plagued in that area, in each specific area we're plagued with the same dilemmas or drama","that uh you know unless you talk about it to someone in your area no one would really","understand. So it's pretty easy to listen to what's is going on, plus that is a part of my","job to listen to what is going on, to take the temperature of our group. Uh And to just kind","of ease them or play as a mediator for different issues that might arise and tension. Uh But","I find that most of the times just listening uh to people really helps and offering","solutions that maybe perhaps they didn't take into consideration if there is something that",30,4.5
"30_segment-03","Uh That's a pretty good question when you're in a situation where you are a part of a team and you have two members that don't work well together and honestly it","happened very frequently especially um in certain areas here in ETS. Um so it's not something, it's not a situation that I'm totally unfamiliar with. Um Typically","I just get to the bottom line of it, um I can approach a business situation very professionally, so um it helps that I'm able to remove the emotion from both sides","and act as a translator. So I'll hear what one side is actually saying so that I can get what the business question actually is in order to respond successfully.","Um And I think that people appreciate the fact that I could remove or can remove emotion from, otherwise emotional situations. Um I just kind of remain calm um","and I find that being calm in a situation where people really don't get along and they have to work together, uh being calm has to help everybody else to get calm.","Identify what it is that their charged with doing and then just get on with it professionally with uh efficient whatever outcome it is. So I think it kind of works","out, most of the time you see those people typically they just stay away from each other unless they absolutely have to. Which is weird because I actually have a","boss who encourages everybody to have tea when there is an issue you know, Go and have coffee or tea together or something like that, but that's not really uh my","approach to it. And I'm not seeing where that works, going to have coffee with people. So you know you just stay in, get to the core of it and try to solve it and",30,4.7
"30_segment-04","This question kind of ties into the last question because a lot of times when you find that people aren't working well together, it has something to do with trust. Um I","recently was promoted into the role that I'm in, so um trying to gain trust in an environment that is otherwise set up immediately to be distrusting is a odd place to be. Uh","So I just kind of really try and focus. Uh Right now I've been charged with cleaning up the budget. There was a lot of issues, um a lot of things happened that should not","have happened in the past and so I have to clean up the budget. I have to find where money went, why money was not properly allocated, um why money might have been hidden in","weird lines um which is automatically uh not a trusting environment especially when you dealing with money but to have to be the one to bear that news and actually find and","know where things happened um is a challenge because you have to tell people that they were wrong. Uh And it's a fine line between being able to solidly say You were wrong","and have the data to back it up versus just running around accusing people. So I really do focus on data, um anything or anything that I say I make sure that I back it up","with data. Again I don't, I remove, I try to remove the emotion from it, because that not what I'm here, I'm not here to accuse anyone you know I just want to simply clear","the air, state the facts and show what happened. Um I think my group pretty much gets about me now, not for the gossip I don't have the time for it. I don't want to be","bothered with it, I find that its too much to keep up with anyway. So I think its pretty easy for me to get the trust of my peers and coworkers and colleagues. I've been",30,5.1
"30_segment-05","There was a company that uh hired me for a dream job that actually did not exist and uh once I was in the","role I discovered that they had these little random odd inequities and rules that um were really","antiquated. They were so outdated it was like from the stone age when people were running around with no","pants, tit was those kinds of rules. Um And I would try to bargain, I called it bartering certain pieces of","the role that I really did not want to be bothered with. And I would take on other parts of other people","roles that they really didn't want be bothered with. And it worked out just fine until the supervisor","caught wind of it and uh she came up with a rule that they is not going to be more bartering. But I think","that was pretty successful because I managed to do that for uh probably over a year to actually carve out a","dream job in a situation where I otherwise I had been intending to leave and did uh plan to leave. Uh But","subsequently the environment changed a bit so there was some leeway, but I'm pretty good at negotiating,",30,4.6
"30_segment-06","um I'm pretty good at persuasion, um bargaining, bartering. So um one example is um we were assigned phone duties. so they have a receptionist and um we have to cover her phones,","we would have to cover her phones. And it would be, supposed to be fifteen minutes in the morning, the lunch break and fifteen minutes in the afternoon. um But this particular","receptionist was known to abuse that, so she literally would say Oh I have to run and do this and be gone for like hours. Which means not only are you doing your job but you are","doing her job which is covering the phones and most of the phone calls that were coming on that line which is supposed to be a main line were personal calls. So um in one of our","group meetings I brought it up, because I had gotten tired of everyone coming to me individually with the same complaint and it was a complaint that I also had. um But it was like","these private conversations that everyone was having with only me. So it wasn't something that anyone was willing to escalate higher so that it could be resolved. Of course I was","so I brought it up in a meeting and I got people to admit that they had those conversations with me. um The outcome was that we all kept logs, started to keep logs of how many","hours over the course of the day we wound up with the phones. um And so I don't know how it was ultimately resolved with the receptionist but I know for us it became easier, um she","was assigned a fifteen minutes break and that was it. Fifteen minutes here, fifteen minutes there was the dedicated time so that everybody could do their own work um instead of","being overwhelmed with the phones. It's one of those antiquated practices of having a dedicated receptionist with no solid back up. She was not even allowed to have even voice mail",30,4.2
"30_segment-07","I have been in a situation where actually frequent more time than not there is someone that I'm not especially fond of not because I don't like like them because I'm not","especially fond of and not necessary dislike them all around. It could be because I don't like them professionally but I thought that they were nice person, it could be","that I didn't think they were a nice person but they were really were good professionals. Uh and recently I had someone that I actually reported to uh that I just like","professionally did not get along with. Uh It's kind of difficult to be charged with a task and no a clear path of achieving successfully all of the objectives, everything","that have been said before but we have someone who does not necessarily know the job. And that's the person that you have to report to uh you know get a satisfactory","outcome or get a agreement that that outcome is satisfactory. Uh this is really tricky, is very tricky. So last year I had a schedule, uh I scheduled over three hundreds","interviews uh for the year which is pretty challenging especially given how some of the panels are set up. And the way that was worked out was that she didn't interfere","with what it is that I had to do and she just focused on the data that I had sent her. So I was able to send her list to show all of the interviews that, you know she is","not aware of how scheduling went so I didn't need her input or her design or her model of how to interview, schedule the interviews. Uh and we were pretty successful uh","AD actually on-boarded quite a few people and it was because of a lot of things that I had done to get all of their candidates in without interruptions to most people's",30,4.3
"30_segment-08","uh With the scheduling at interviews, it's not necessarily unpleasant it's not tedious, it's not boring, it's not physically demanding but it requires no brain skills so um it's","easy to get into, but and just not want to do it. um Across the board we all were charged we had all these groups that we had to schedule for. Some groups had more scheduling than","the others. So I was always assigned to the heaviest group and it was just strange because every few months I would get a new group and the new group that I got had to have","heaviest volume that they had ever experience in the year. So within an year I was able to get almost all of the groups who had the heaviest volume at some point in time and when","the volume go down, I would get assigned in another group. Which it was a job, it wasn't my favorite part of the job but it was the job and it was a job that everyone had to do.","um And I found that a lot of the other admins would complain and use the word 'overwhelmed.' um And so as a way to a make it so that they feel overwhelmed I had to supervisor who","would come to me and say Can you help such and such because she is overwhelmed. But she didn't take it into consideration that at the time I had the heaviest volume. And the way I","handled that was just to simply say No and I was okay with that. um The outcome to me was successful if worse than to find alternatives or deal with the fact that they were","charged with the same task that I was charged with. And to handle it professionally in a way that they needed to and to get their job done. But I'm pretty okay with saying No as","well so you know. Most people don't like hearing 'no' but um because I'm blunt about things so when they hear a no from me they know it's not emotions it's just is basically what",30,3.5
"30_segment-09","I've never really encountered this type of situations so I can't really answer this","one, uh where people ignore contributions. It's not a safe route to take and I think","that most managers who are managers and are able to maintain their position as","managers know that is poor form and it will not lead to successful um work","environment. You wont get very far ignoring contributions that they might not try and","make a big 'hoopla' about peoples contributions. And they might minimize them but I","don't know about the blatant just ignoring them, so [I cant really], that would be","really weird. uh I haven't encountered that at any company that I've worked for. That","will be kind of awkward especially if you are in a position when you are managing","strategic teams and you have to keep cycling out for different teams, for different",30,2.7
"30_segment-10","uh This question is kind of, I guess a double edged sword, I came from a very heavily driven SOP environment. So um","communication was probably SOP and operation was, is still highly successful so in that sense I didn't have to overcome","any communication problems. um And I don't think I have ever felt like there was a communication problem as it was","pertains to me. I can see communications problems as it pertains to other people, but that's just because of again","distrusting environment. uh And I think I'm pretty much still working through that because again I'm still within the","roles. And I don't know, I'm still trying to figure out how to get people to effectively communicate with each other","especially if there is a pair that just really just don't talk at all. And I think that one feels threatened any other","who was just promoted as well feels challenged and it's just like oil and vinegar. So I'm still kind of working through","that on how to get them to successfully communicate on things that they have to and I think that is where the issue it","is for me. I don't think they will ever just be pals, sit around talking but it's kind of tricky, still kind of trying",30,3
"30_segment-11","I think this questions come from like little snapshot in my new role because uh again I have been charged with the task of communicating difficult information on a daily","sometimes basis. Um I just kind of rely on the data so if I have to say that something happened or something occurred I always make sure that I have data to back it up. Um","My introduction to that was there is this naughty list uh that the officers go on for auto approved time. And um uh the officer that I support just lived on that list, his","name was always on that list, every week, week after week after week. And it's a part of the officers objectives not to be on this list or to significantly reduce their","presence on this list. And up until this point I had not involved into actually approving time and I was charged with the task of ensuring that, that number drops","significantly. So for a few months I was able to get him off of the list uh and it was a challenge with an ED who always said I approve the time but she never had the data","that she approved the time. Uh But because I'm data driven I know that you can track anything and everything so I would always, I always, its a secret I don't tell anyone","but I always track the time that I approve and I do that by taking screen shots. Uh So that if there is an issue and he does need the list I have sheen shots that shows this","person never appeared on my list. Uh It's successful and he's pleased and it's actually good the whole team including that particular ED is pleased. Because now she doesn't","have to worry about every week having the conversation with the officer about no approving time. So the issue is resolved, there's some nuances there but that's when new",30,5.7
"30_segment-12","um For me I have never encountered this issue, for me it would be the reverse. um I was","always groomed that in order to be successful at communicating you had to communicate. I","think for me um when I first learned how to speak to people it was like you had to talk","to people as though they only had a seventh grade education and nothing here at ETS it's","reversed. I don't think people here um were taught that so, well I've never had this","issue of explaining a complex or technical idea to someone that's not technical,","unfamiliar. I think that a lot of people would do well to answer this question here at","ETS because I'll find that when they talk about things they use a lot of, not only do","they use a lot of words, many words to say what they need to say. But they use words that","are not necessary, they use complex words to talk about average things. So I have never",30,2.7
"32_segment-01","A work situation where I was not the formal leader uh is with the quality team that I work with here in the Quality Excellence Department of","the Office of Quality. Uh There are probably six quality engineers uh one of which is a Senior Quality Engineer and two of which are Quality","Managers. The background is that we were all tasked about reading a book uh about strength binders and then we had to take uh some kind of quiz","and it resulted in analysis about what our strengths were on strategy, on uh a couple of different, four different dimensions. And the task uh","from our executive director was to put together a presentation. So [the behavior that I carried out in response], so when the team gets","together there are a number of different ideas and personalities but in an attempt to get to uh the final work product which was the","presentation. I did take a leadership sort of task and initiative to sort of guide the discussion, make sure that we stayed on task. Uh And","ensure that our work product uh [was one], it met the objectives uh that in terms of the PowerPoint presentation, that it was, you know quality","and something that we could present to both the Vice President and to the team. The outcome was a success, I was able to uh not only guide the","conversation but as well do the PowerPoint slide and then revise it as needed to make sure it was coherent once all of the other quality",32,5.6
"32_segment-02","I was able to build um motivation um with an iVEC intern that joined the Office of Quality this past summer. um She was from Princeton","University, she was in operations um and um I was her mentor for the summer. [The behaviors that I carried out is] coming in this is my","first time being a mentor, this is her first time interning here at ETS. I wanted to talk to her about what her goals were, make sure that","there were clear and defined objectives for the projects and for the ten weeks summer. And um so I would meet with her on a weekly basis","just to make sure that she didn't have any concerns, that she had all the information that she needed um and the support and the resources.","The outcome was that she was able to make a successful presentation um to the leadership of the internship program and as well to a number","of her cohorts. um She did go back to Princeton at the end of the summer and most recently she did request that I provide her with a","reference letter um which sort of summarized what she was able to accomplish here at ETS during her two thousand fourteen um iVEC","internship. So it was a successful internship, she was satisfied with the outcome and what she learned, um there were a number of seminars","and learning opportunities for her and she did uh rise to the occasion in learning as well as um exhibiting and sort of communicating what",32,5.7
"32_segment-03","So most recently I was a member of a team where two individuals did not work well together um and that sort of surfaced and some conversation. And I","believe they weren't working well together because they were just competing priorities, um so their focuses were different. um And also their objectives","and their roles were also different um and they have different responsibilities. So the behaviors that I carried out in response to the situation was","that one person eventually um got up and they were probably about five or six people in this particular meeting as well. One person you know pretty much","put on the table what their expectations were, that their expectations were not met and left the meeting. The other person uh turned to me um um","believing that I had some responsibility and maybe even the lack of communication or understanding of ensuring that those, the expectations were met. um","I, my behavior was pretty much just a focus on what the outcome of the task needed to be and to ensure that both expectations were met. um So at that","time what I did was just try and refocus um some of the discussion, you know sort of um repeat what I heard um and ask for the information that I needed","in order to take the next steps. um In terms of some of the behaviors that were exhibited in that exchange I did have some slight conversation about how","we should handle ourselves professionally. um But other than that just really reworking the task to make sure that both parties um were satisfied with",32,5.5
"32_segment-04","You know this particular question sort of, um with the focus on gaining the trust of others that you're working with. um On one hand I'm thinking about sort of a","personal situation and on the other hand I'm thinking about, uh you know sort of a working relationship. uh And I'm going to say for the, for a working","relationship, um I was tasked with working with a temp on some mapping um exercises. um I don't think that she was very knowledgeable and I don't think that she was","trained in all of some of the competencies that she needed to come to the table with. So I was trying to convince her that uh here's how things have been done in","the past and that there needed to be some level of change management as we move towards how she was trying to pull at the task, I mean sort of manage it from an","administrative, so she was more in an administrative role. The behavior that I carried out in response to that was trying to make sure that she understood the","parties that were already engaged um in that particular task before what we had come to expect and sort of highlighting some of the different things that she was","trying to roll out. And just talking about you know how we can just sort of smooth over and make sure she could get to what she wanted. But that we could also um","ensure that it wasn't too disruptive to how we were managing the task previously, such as having some of those conversations. I think nit was more collaborative in","ensuring that we both understood sort of our role. And the outcome was that the task did get done and going forward the um tasks are successful because it's an",32,5.1
"32_segment-05","So a few weeks ago uh there was, we were working on some ISO registration activity. And uh we had to work to ensure across the quality engineering","team that a certain number of tasks were completed before the registrar came in, so that's the background of the situation. Uh Mutually favorable","outcome was that we were having daily meetings first thing in the morning with all the quality engineers uh talking about, you know sort of going","through the status of every action item. So they were quite a few and we were mainly focusing on those that were delinquent or past due between a","sixty day time frame. The morning meetings were not in my opinion going very well uh so one of the behaviors that uh I carried out in response to","that situation was a discussion that said that very directly, very straight forward. That, you know [didn't], I felt like the meetings could be run","a little differently uh and the way that the discussions were being had we weren't providing strategy and sort of help and assistance with getting","the action items complete. But it was sort of berating, uh so the outcome was I ended up having to run the meeting. So mutually favorable outcome","meant that we were able to as a team, work together to complete the task but it was more focused on not why this the and why it isn't done, but","here's what we need to do in order to get this particular task completed. So the outcome was that we were able to work down uh the delinquencies of",32,5.4
"32_segment-06","So probably about, I want to say at least probably a month and a half ago. I'm sitting around with the board of quality excellence team. um And we send out","notifications to the ETS organization um about process competencies that need to be completed, process competencies are um reviews and sort of training on work","instructions that you're responsible for in your role.uh What ended up happening was we were sending out, you know um notifications for competencies that needed","to be complete but the note the communication itself was not effective. So you would receive an email and there would be links in that email that were designed","to help you complete the task but the communication itself had a link that sort of took you to not to sort of the long route to completing the task. um And you","know after talking with some of my internal stakeholders um it had gotten highlighted that the communication was not effective. And so I went to the broader, the","broader team and said We should probably change this link so that it takes them directly to um what the documents they need to see and review and complete","competency on. So [not only did I suggest what I thought would be more effective communication], [I also,] there were some doubts in the room that that link","could be provided in that email. But I also, um you know came up with the link, tested it out and sent it to the system admins for them to go ahead and review it","for effectiveness. And the outcome of that whole situation was that the communications were changed um and it included a direct link for those that needed to",32,5.8
"32_segment-07","There are not many people that I don't like or not get along with, what I will say is that sometimes there is a personality conflict and I don't","take it personally. Uh But [there is a particular], I don't know if it's a particular time because it's ongoing, I work with the person uh pretty","consistently but [the person], I'm a person that I believe I'm very confident and I like uh a decent amount of autonomy when I do my work. Uh","there's a particular person uh that micro manages and so uh you know and there's sort of that, there's sort of a conflict there. Uh and [so what I","do is I try and], I did talk with my mentor, I did seek some outside help once the, how to manage the situation so that I wasn't sort of rubbed","and that person didn't feel like I wasn't, you know so that we could built trust, so that she wouldn't micro manage. Uh and I now interact with","the person by overwhelming her with information, so to keep her from micro managing. So I figure if I'm more proactive at providing information on","tasks and things like that then uh I won't be micromanaged or told specifically how to do something. Uh the outcome is that it's a work in","progress, uh you know [it has, I think the relationship has gone], but I don't even know if she sees the sort of relationship as a problem because","I haven't said I don't like this. Uh I just have thought about trying to manage it so that for me it's a little bit more comfortable, so I",32,5.2
"32_segment-08","In terms of uh unpleasant tasks shared uh amongst employees I can necessarily say that in anything that I do there's anything that's physically demanding, but","sometimes tedious and boring. uh Yeah, there's a lot of sort of administrative, such things that have to get done um and I'll definitely say that I prefer the sort","of human interaction um and sort of problem solving um uh portion of my particular role. uh So there are times when I'm assigned I feel, you know certain issues","that are outside of what I've been assigned responsibility to. And I generally just tend to, I generally just tend to manage it. um And so for example if there's a","Kappa determination that uh is outside of maybe one of my assigned functional areas, I'll try and look for how it does relate to an area or function that I am","assigned to. And I'll try and sort of specifically negotiate with those people. There are also um times when things that are assigned to other people that I feel","should have been assigned to me and I'll also try and sort of shift and sort of negotiate where I'll take this particular assignment, you'll take that particular","assignment. um So that at least in terms of getting the work done um I'm at least working with individuals that I have relationships with. So the outcome is at the","end of the day we know that our leadership wants all the assignments managed. And so just sort of negotiating with my team members on who does what. um I'll","definitely sort of reach out to individuals that I have more of a relationship with um and I feel like that creates an efficiency in getting the work done, even",32,5.3
"32_segment-09","So there's an ongoing sort of program uh where considered design, design for control activities. Uh And there, I guess it's more around, the issue is more around change","management. But for design for control a lot of times we're looking at programs that area already sort of operational and trying to ensure that we can ensure accuracy","and timeliness of completion of sworn, right? To the customer. Uh And now there's sort of been a shift to design, doing design for control activities around uh programs","that are not yet operational, so actually putting controls and putting those things in place. uh So um one of the leaders of the group sort of sets the stage for how,","you know for the task for me as a quality engineer in terms of following up on action items and controls and so on and so forth. So I try to help the person understand","that there's been a shift in responsibilities, that more of the responsibility was shifted on my particular function. That certain inputs that generally would be","provided were not provided uh and that there were details uh that were left out and that it would cause more. So I handled the situation by, it's, he doesn't share the","same opinion that I do because he doesn't share um the burden of the additional work. But I did, what I did was I communicated what my concerns were um and I suggested","that we have a meeting, um that meeting has not been scheduled um and what I did do was was then I escalated it to uh my manager who has oversight of the activity. Just","to let them know that there are some concerns and that we do need to have a meeting to ensure that at the end of the day that the design for control of activities get",32,5.6
"32_segment-10","You know in terms of listening skills uh I'd definitely say most times I am engaged on the forefront of any communications.","um I will say that um there was a particular instance that comes to mind where I communicated to someone something that uh","was not, you know that you know I was going on vacation and so on and so forth and that I couldn't complete a certain task","within a certain time frame. um And you know um essentially I had to sit down um with my manager and sort of understand","what that communication needed to be and the future. So um in terms of listening skills apparently I guess I must have","missed some kind of initial communication. um You know and what I need to do in the future is if I have any constraints on","time lines given, you know being on vacation or out of office, I need to not communicate that to the person that's making","the request but I need to communicate it to my manager first so that they can potentially um find some kind of workaround","or someone else to delegate the task to. So there was a communications problem I guess I was the problem in that particular","instance. But now I know how to better handle um any constraints with my schedule in order to make sure that tasks are",32,4
"32_segment-11","um A particular um instance, it comes up when I had to communicate difficult information to my supervisor who's surrounding a Kappa determination","that must be sort of processed within a certain time frame, um it's generally like, it has to closed within five days. And so the the issue owner","that I had to follow up with was not being responsive. So um what I needed to do was to communicate to my supervisor that all the steps that I had","taken to try and reach out to the individual and get the information that was required to close it, um I wasn't able um to get that done. So I","communicated via email um what the details of the Kappa determination were, who the issue owner was and that um I communicated to them via email,","via phone. um And forwarded along a train of conversation that was evidence that I had made an effort to get this particular task completed. um","The outcome was that it did get escalated and it was something that uh my supervisor ended up having to follow up on and work. uh To date I'm not","sure that she's been able to get it closed but the outcome was that I don't like to ideally escalate things, um I like to try and work it. But","once it get to the point that, um you know metrics and things are not and it's in sort of, it's sort of indicative of my performance or lack of","performance then I have to sort of escalate it so it demonstrates that I've done, I've taken a certain number of steps and actions to try and get",32,5.3
"32_segment-12","uh I did have a conversation with, I have a son about what it is that I do at work. Um And I remember this was probably, I don't know, he was probably","on the second or the third grade. um And so I explained to him what it meant to be a quality engineer and to work in Six Sigma. Um And trying to","explain what that means that I do. And so one of the examples that I gave him was process mapping. um And he was not familiar with process mapping, he","may have been familiar with like maps, right? How to locate something, but in terms of process mapping. So in trying to explain to him sort of the","details around process mapping we talked about how you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. um How you have to one you have to get a plate, you","have to get utensils, you have your inputs are, you know bread, peanut butter, jelly  the stuff that you have to take. And so um, so I sort of","translated process mapping to an example of a situation that he actually had personal experience with. um And the behavior that I carried out, was","trying to be perceptive of what his understanding was and translating it to his level of knowledge and understanding. And the outcome was he","understands what it is that in part, what it is that I do at work. And he's also a, he also likes patterns so also there are times and just sort of","explaining situations to him. Where I sort of map it out in sort or writing things down so he can just visually see it um that I also believe also",32,6.3
"33_segment-01","As a waitress in a restaurant, I had the position of being a leader but not with a leadership role since","there is a manager and a boss that is in charge of the restaurant and their employees. You have to stand","in as a manager when the manager is no longer there. My manager is a father and runs a golf course and a","restaurant at the same time, so he is very spread out, his work load is very heavy and he does not spend","a lot of time in the restaurant. So therefore I had to assume a leadership role without formally being","recognized. From training employees to helping out in the kitchen, to making quick decisions about what","to do with messed up orders or uh doing things that normally a manager would do. Receiving people,","communicating with other staff, was very important to my work situation. And that's how I felt like I","was a leader in work and not in work. So as a leader without recognition I felt that I had got more out","of my job because even though I wasn't being recognized, I still had a very important job at the",33,5.8
"33_segment-02","And my past job as a waitress has made me be able to get a job in the student center at The","College of New Jersey, where I moved from information desk worker to building assistant, to now I","am student manager. And with that important role of being manager, I have to be the motivation for","my fellow employees as well as my coworkers. I have to make sure that every task is completed on","shift and that the goals and emotions felt while on shift are happy and positive. With that","there's sometimes problems with events and setups in the student center and as my role as a leader","I have to make sure that all my employees are comfortable with doing last minute setups. Such as","when an event is needing electrical equipment but it was not provided, therefore everyone needs to","work together and get the job accomplished. So through a positive attitude and a smile on my face","I believe that I motivated my employees as well to get the job done as well as enjoy their job",33,4.8
"33_segment-03","Working on group projects is a part of college and knowing that not every person in the group will get along and work well together. In","order to get a group project uh accomplished we all have to do our part. Creating Google Docs using technology really helps situations","in which members of the group did not agree. For example when I was in my film class, we had to make a movie about anything we chose.","From the beginning it was hard to agree on the topic and the script and the characters and where it was going to be located, but","compromising really helped the situation. Not only knowing our specific jobs such as one person was a camera, the camera director and","the next person was a script writer and the other people were the actors. It really helped out uh when the group members did not work","well together because each person had their specific job to work on. And not only did that give someone the focus and drive to get the","project accomplished, but it also helped out the group as a whole. So even if the two members did not agree on a specific thing that had","to do with the project, each one had their own specific jobs and that really helps the problem of not getting along. And we got our","group project done [and that] and we received an A on it. So I believe that using technology and working together really helped to get",33,4.2
"33_segment-04","Every time I go to work I have to negotiate with my employees whether to get the job done. From coming in late to not doing","their jobs, to being very rude to customers. I have to make sure that only are they doing their job correctly, but they have","trust in the people that they worked with and as well as with me. Negotiating with them from doing tasks to getting jobs","accomplished to not getting in trouble by our professional staff really sums up the day that I have to do every day. Not only","do I have to deal with staff members coming in late but they're also very rude to me and to the other fellow employees.","Gaining the trust of others really has to do with communicating to them as if you are equals. So making sure that everyone at","work is equal and feel included and is a part of the team effort, that really helps. Not only if I gain their trust, then I","can easily negotiate with them. From not getting in trouble for coming in late and doing another job instead to get out of a","proper punishment seems like a pretty good negotiation considering that they would get in trouble and are on the verge of","being terminated, fired from their position really helps my goal of getting a job accomplished. So trust and negotiation are",33,3.4
"33_segment-05","In order to bargain and compromise with someone for a mutual favorable outcome, I","have to make sure that we are on a more personal level. Because if they trust me","and, then the compromise will be a lot easier. For example on Monday night, my","employee texted me at six o'clock stating that she was going to be late to work,","but she would bring me food to make sure that she did not get in trouble. And I","felt like that was a pretty good compromise for her to get a good outcome out of","it. Because she would not get in trouble for what she had done, because it isn't","a very big deal if someone is late for a shift, even an hour late which she was","late, an hour late. But no one said anything because we've all got something out","of it, the compromise for all of us was pretty good and the outcome was even",33,3
"33_segment-06","As a member of a sorority I have to make sure that I am pretty good at compromising and trying to persuade others of ideas that I have about myself","or about positions I hold in the organization. I am the Publicity and Historian Chair for my sorority and I have to make sure that what I do is","approved by the Executive Board. I run the Instagram, the Twitter and the Facebook. Not only do I have to keep up with all these forms of social","media, but I have to make sure everything I post is accurate and important to our sorority. Not only posting about birthdays and sisters of the week,","but we have to post uh about on our events on campus and what other sororities are, what they are doing. Such as other chapters from other schools","and how they interact with us, and what they need and how they'll reach out to us on all these forms of medias is very important. But as the Social","Media Chair I had to bring to the attention of the Executive Board that I wanted to start a weekly picture post on Instagram and I had to make sure","this was going to be appropriate. Not only did I convince them that this was going to be a good idea, but it was a success considering the amount of","likes and publicity I did get from the post. I started a 'Travel Tuesday' idea on our account and it was very well received. Not only did the sisters","feel important but we also started to get our name out there more using Instagram which is very important to recruiting new members and keeping",33,4.2
"33_segment-07","Working in a group setting is very important to college and the teacher, especially in the work field. Not only do you have to","work with people you don't like but you have to make sure that you do get the task accomplished, even with a personal thing in","the way. Every time you work someone, even if you're great on a personal level it is important to get what you need to get done","accomplished. Especially during college where I do have to work on a lot of group projects with another person, from creating a","project in the PowerPoint to show to the class. I had to make sure that we do not seem that we do not like each other. It is","very hard to get along with every single person you meet but if you do it in a professional and a way that no one is feelings","so are then the situation will be okay. Especially in one of my classes where we have to give a PowerPoint presentation and","teach the class a lesson. We have to make sure that we both know what we are doing. And we have to make sure that we meet at a","mutual time and place where we both will be able to work on this project and get, receive a good grade for our efforts. So it","really doesn't matter if you do not like a person in a group but if you get what you need to get done, then it shouldn't matter",33,4
"33_segment-08","Completing unpleasant tasks are usually very prominent in minimum wage employees. From usually if you're an intern or you just started off in a","company, you have to do a task that you really do not want to do. From physically demanding tasks, to boring tasks. You have to make sure that","you make every single job somewhat comical or funny. Because even if don't feel like doing it, you have to make your time worthwhile in each","task, even though it's not something you would want to do. You have to make sure you do it correctly to move on in another part of the company.","Especially working in a restaurant knowing that people are rude and disgusting, and cleaning up plates can be really gross and physically","demanding at times, and not enjoyable. Getting the job done and putting on a smile face is the most important thing. From folding boxes for box","lunches, uh to cleaning plates in the kitchen, waitressing sometimes doesn't seem like the best job or you might not be suited for it. But if","you seem to put a smile on your face and act as if it's a positive experience, then it won't be tedious or boring. Especially while working at","the golf course last summer I had to fold hundreds of hundreds of boxes for box lunches, and that was very tedious. But using my time wisely","and talking and listening to music if you are allowed to, made the job less boring. So if you put a positive twist on everything it won't be",33,5.7
"33_segment-09","In a group project, it's very important for everyone's opinion to be heard. Ranging from the smallest thing as that the project should not be on a","PowerPoint to saying a couple of words that don't make sense to the project, each opinion does have importance. Especially in a communications class, where","everyone has to participate, it is very important to important to have your own opinion. Not only do you not want the other group members to take over the","role of every single position, but you also do not want your professors and fellow classmates not to recognize you as a substantial part of a group. Using","the theory of group think where every person in the group has to think the same, and is pressured to think the same even if they don't feel as if it's","right, that is a problem with a group project.    Groupthink is horrible and not easily ignored, but it happens very easily as well. Every person in the","group is almost peer pressured into thinking a certain way in doing something a certain way even though they are ignoring their own opinion. So in order to","stop groupthink every single person needs to have their own opinion in a group. And especially in a communications class such as the ones I have to take, I","have to make sure that each person has their own say, and is heard. Especially in the film class I took, using having roles and putting in their opinion","was very important, even though it seemed long. The meetings were long and tedious, it really helped everyone feel as if they are an individual and a",33,3.7
"33_segment-10","One of the main problems with working with other people is communication. Communication is always a problem ranging from your young years on sport teams to the working","world. Knowing that communication is always going to be a problem and that certain people won't be heard, listening is an important skill to acquire. From listening to","employers complain about their problems and not responding also gives them a chance to vet and get out their issues. Especially at my job over the summer where I was an","intern in a research company we had to order binders on binders in order to put studies to go out to the coordinators of studies in other states. The binders had to be the","correct size, and the people ordering them sometimes ordered the wrong size because they were not listening, and that was a communication's problem.    And just standing","there, even though I had a less important role in the company, standing there and listening to the people complaining about what other people said to them, and how they went","wrong really helped them then, and helped them not bring a negative attitude to the rest of the company. Even from the smallest thing of just standing there and listening to","the problems, a person discuss their problem really helps the work environment and not only helps the other people become more productive. Listening can also help a person","recognize that they were wrong in a situation and they should have done something in a certain way or they should apologize for doing something. Apologizing to the woman","that she had freaked out on about ordering the wrong binders, was the correct thing to do after she discussed it with someone.

"33_segment-11","While I was working for my internship over the summer, I had to make sure that every single paper I was copying was in","the correct order. And some of the information was not there. In using critical skills and knowing that each part of","this study I was copying, making sure that each paper clip and each staple was in the correct spot was very important","to the job at hand. Because these studies were going out to the companies that needed them and we were in charge of","very valuable information, and knowing that sometimes the information was not there. Telling my boss that the","information was not properly done before hand was very difficult. Because she was very involved in the study and","knowing that someone didn't do their job correctly, and that could affect her job was very valid and very important to","the way she felt about her job. So handling in a positive manner and making sure to tell her in a private setting was","very important with no one around.

From putting up projectors","to hooking something into the wall, it is very difficult to explain technical things that go on in the","student center. But using common language and [making sure], walking a person step by step through the","process really helps get the job done.

And I made sure that","they knew exactly what they were doing  and if they had any questions that they would ask. That really",33,4.7
"35_segment-01","Okay, well a work situation in which I wasn't the formal leader but tried to take on leadership role. um Well my current job basically is being a student so this would apply","to basically every group project ever. I love being in charge of things and I love just kind of having the reigns on situations. So basically in every group project I've ever","done I've tried to be the leader. So one instance is was very recently we had a group just discussion in class but I always insist on just kind of giving people things to do.","I consider what they're good at, what I perceive them to be good at. Whether that is or is not true, I consider what they say, what they want to do. And then I'll try, since","I'm not a formal leader I'll try to nudge them into doing what I want them to do. Sometimes if that doesn't work I'll explicitly say you should do this. And usually even","though I don't have a formal leadership position, they will do it. And it usually works out well because I typically have a good direction.   I can't think of an incidence","where it didn't work out well other than the times that somebody else tried to do what I was doing and take an informal leadership role. During these situations we tend to","butt heads a bit more but it's still very productive and [we still], [I'm very good at] [if somebody else] if somebody else tries to take leadership I'm very good at just kind","of relinquishing the power and I can kind of be like the beta to their alpha, whatever it is in wolf packs, I don't know. But I'm very good at kind of going with what they","want to do but enforcing kind of their ideals, and not their ideas for the situation. So in all in all it never really works out badly when I try to assume the leadership",35,4
"35_segment-02","In my current role as a student I don't really have subordinates so it does not really apply to me. And if I do have subordinates it's just in my mind nobody else is real well but I think of them","like that. But what I do have would be coworkers, which would be my peers, my friends and all the time we like to have study groups together. [Really just genuinely] not just enjoy being in each","other's company but we feel that we can work better when we do with each other because we each have different strengths and different weaknesses and we can pick each other up where we tend to","fall. So back on a situation, I'll give you one from like last week. We were all studying for a Spanish exam and some of my friends are really bad at Spanish, I'm very good at Spanish. So we're","working together, we're doing this, then all of a sudden we kind of just lost our steam. We stopped doing it as well and then we got distracted, there's girl's on like Facebook, there's others who","are just not literally not paying attention, texting their boyfriends.    So me and my other friend we both like to take kind of a leadership role. We were like Okay, if we study for one more hour","we can go get Froyo. And every girl ever loves Froyo, even if they say don't they secretly do. So they are like all very into, they're like Okay let's do this. And for that one hour they were very","gung-ho about it. And I feel like the promise of the reward at the end was an incredible motivator for them because it was something that they wanted, something that they look forward to. So in","any situation I feel like kind of offering incentives for people to do their best or to do well or to try really is the best way to go about it because I don't think it's possible for there to be","a bad outcome if you're offering people something they want in exchange for something that they are fully within their power to do. Which is exactly what happened in that situation with my group",35,5.2
"35_segment-03","So around two years ago I was working on a nursing project with um a group of girls that I had been assigned. So none of us in any other situation would really have chosen each other, but there is this one","girl she was very party girl, very like me, me, me, like to have a good time, let everyone know it. And another girl who was very quiet, she was an ROTC, she just, very like wholesome kind of morally extremely","sound. And then this girl who just fundamentally who did not get along and of course they had to put them together in my group. So that wasn't bad for like the first two days then they started really just","getting under each other's skin. They would purposefully just sabotage the others work and then blamed it on them. And just kind of be like, Oh well she can't do anything right. We shouldn't give her things to","do in this project. So there is nothing really that we could do since they didn't get along on such a deep down level. So what me and the other girl who had been in the group tried to do was we just kind of","sat down and set up meeting as a group for the project.    We were just like Listen, you guys are being kind of ridiculous, you need to get over this. You don't have to be friends after this. You don't have to","talk to each other again. We just need to finish our project, present it and then be done with it. You guys do not have to associate with each other after this. After that uh they realized that what we were","saying was right and even though they didn't really want to hear it, it was what they needed to get from the other members of the group. They needed to know that they were just kind of being ridiculous. So","after we had that whole discussion, they for, in the next week they kind of still were jamming at each other but after that they just got over it. They didn't talk to each other. They refused to speak to each","other which was fine because we didn't need them to speak to each other to do well but they did end up both putting in their equal part and presenting and everything went very smoothly more so than we ever",35,4.2
"35_segment-04","When working with anyone I feel like you need to have trust there, whether it's just kind of ingrained in them to trust you and you to trust them or whether you","have to earn it. So in situations where trust is key like in every situation, um I usually try to get them to trust in my ability and myself as a person before","everything else. So in order to gain their trust as a person basically all I do is I make them like me as a person because I feel like once you like someone as a","person it's easier to trust them. But in order to make them trust in my abilities that's often a bit more difficult. Um I'll somehow just segue into a story about","this time that I did this thing that was completely related to our assignment even if it's not and give them details about it that make me seem just very","competent and make it seem like I know what I'm doing. Um That's all you really can do in that situation, you just have to repeatedly give them reasons to trust","you in order for them to do so. I've never been unsuccessful in getting people to trust me in a work situation. I feel like if somebody doesn't trust you in a","work situation that's your fault. Like it's really not difficult to gain trust in that situation because it's so easy to get and there's no reason for them to not","trust you because it's such a superficial situation that I don't really know, it's just trust actually hasn't been something that I would really consider much on","a deep level. I feel like I just naturally trust people when I work with them because I have to, you're kind of forced to. If you don't trust them then you don't",35,3.6
"35_segment-05","Okay so I bargain and compromise a lot in work situations. It's the way I know best to get things done because then people would be more likely to do what you ask","them if you give them something in return. So my best friend and I we often do this kind of bartering exchange where she's very good at things that I'm very bad","at. So in order for me to get her help on things I'll have to give her help on things. So typically what we do is if we're like say outlining a few chapters of a","book, I'll get her to outline them, not them but the ones that she has most familiarity with and the ones that she feels most comfortable with. And then I'll do","the ones that I feel the most comfortable with because usually they are just at the polar ends of the spectrum and then we'll just exchange. So she'll give me the","ones that she did, I'll give her the ones I did. I also do this in my family, with my sisters. I feel like in families if you don't barter are you really even a","family. Because sometimes you just want something of them but God knows siblings will not do anything unless you're helping them. So they'll be like Oh I won't","tell mom that you did this if I can borrow that sweater next weekend. And that usually works. What else do I compromise? Just generally in work situations when you","don't quite agree on something as often a compromise has to be reached in order for you to be productive. Yeah I feel like this is just a very general question","because generally you always have to compromise if you and someone else both feel very strongly about something. Bargaining is a bit different but I already",35,4.4
"35_segment-06","So I've always had a very, I think they label it 'expressive,' an expressive uh communication style. So I do when I need to persuade people instead of","relying on facts and logic and just very straightforward I often take the approach where I use my opinions and emotion. And I feel like that's a very","effective way to get people to see things your way because it's a lot easier to sway people based on like, Oh this is so awful, how could you believe that?","Or like It makes me so sad that you would think that. Instead of just saying facts that are just very straightforward cut and dried, black and white. The","gray area I feel is what convinces people most often than the other ends of the spectrum. So what's the time? I can't think of a specific time but I know","myself and I know what I do. It's just I really use the facts on situation. I'll lay them out but I don't use them as a persuasive tool as often as I'll use","my own opinions or my own feelings about a subject.    I'll just instead of setting up the facts and saying, This is this, what do you think? I'll just keep","coming at them and be like, Why do you feel this way? What could I do to change your opinion? This is my opinion, why is your opinion different? Can I hear","your opinion? What do you think differently about this subject that I should know. And I feel like eventually you can convince them to see it from your","perspective and they are much more likely to change their own opinions to yours if you keep just giving them reasons to, that are based within emotion and",35,3.3
"35_segment-07","I tried so hard to think of a situation where I had to work with someone I don't like and","get along with. But I honestly couldn't because I'm one of those people where I try to see","the good in people even if they're horribly annoying or awful person. I like to try to","find something about them that I can relate to that'll make it easier for me to work with","them and get along with them. I can't think of a single person I don't like purely based","on this. um If I don't initially like someone I will work with them as I work with any","other person. I try not to let that get in the way of things and then eventually somewhere","along the line I'll warm up to them and I will like them. But to be completely honest I","cannot think of a single situation where any amount of dislike I might have held for a","person got in the way of me being productive and me doing the task at hand or something",35,4.5
"35_segment-08","In this situation it would honestly depend on which kind of unpleasant task.um I know the physically demanding tasks, I'd be like No thanks, like you guys can do that","if you give me more than my fair share of that. I'd be very upset but um  the tedious and boring tasks, those just typically have to do with just things that you do","repeatedly and just kind of on and on and on. But in general that's the kind of stuff I like, I like how methodical it is, I like just the routine of it so I usually","get more than my fair share of that task. The tasks that I don't enjoy are the ones where you have to really, this sounds bad, where you really have to just actively","think about it or you have to be very creative, where you have to think on the spot. And that is not the kind of thing I enjoy but typically that's the kind of thing","that other people enjoy. So they'll usually scoop up that responsibility and I'll take the tedious boring task that nobody else wants because I find it very relaxing.","This happens a lot in um my internship because I am an intern. So as they are doing things, calling people I work in a health insurance firm. As they're doing things,","calling people I'm usually just scanning things, copying things, entering things into spreadsheets, sending out mass emails. That is what I like to do. [I find it just","really], the methodicalness of it just comforting and that's what I enjoy doing and they just welcome me doing it because it is something that they find tedious,","boring, unpleasant and that they want to get off their plate as soon as possible. So I don't typically have problems in this area with other people or with other group",35,4.5
"35_segment-09","I can't really remember the context of this situation but I do know that I've been in a group, working on a group project before where someone's all consuming leadership has been an issue.","And the other people in the group were bothered by it because the person was not taking any input. They were just saying Okay, we're going to do this, this, this, you're going to do this.","And then people would try to offer up opinions, because the girl was not doing a spectacular job, she was just doing what she wanted to do. And she wasn't listening because I had some pretty","great ideas to be completely honest. But uh she just wasn't listening, she wasn't incorporating them she was just like uh-huh and threw them by the way side. So the other people in the group","didn't want to confront her because they didn't want to cause tension or issues. And in the middle of group discussion one day I just got so fed up with it. I was just like Are you kidding?","And she was like, What do you mean? And I just said to her, I was like You are being completely unfair. You are being a tyrant. You need to stop. just generally things of that nature.","Eventually she was kind of offended by it I'll be honest but it was for the good of the group because after I kind of chastised her and yelled at her a little she stepped down and it became","more of a group effort after that. There was no more all consuming leadership role, it was just us pitching our opinions. We changed around a lot of what had already been done but we left in","some of what she had wanted to be fair because we couldn't cut her out completely like she did to us. So all in all I think it went pretty well. Sometimes you just have to be very firm in","what you want and how you think you need to act in order just to get it. And sometimes it's better to cause a little tension in the group if it's for the overall and greater good of the",35,2.7
"35_segment-10","I feel like, or no, I feel as though using listening skills in order to overcome communication problems isn't just a work problem at all. I feel","that's just a life problem because you're always going to encounter people who don't want to listen to what you have to say or who hear what you","have to say and just take it the wrong way or ignore it completely. um I feel like especially within my group of peers who I often have to work","with, there's a lot of incidences where someone just misconstrues something that's said by another person or there's a lot of he-said, she-said and","that often causes issues. What I tend to do is I'll go straight to the source regardless of which one of my friends is having an issue. I'll go","straight to the source and be like, Hey what did you say or hey did you actually say this? And usually they are very quick to clarify what happened","and then I can just kind of report back like, This isn't really an issue you just didn't understand what she was saying, or this isn't an issue","because she never actually said that. So I feel like it's not so much how you listen, it's so much how you listen. It's not what you hear, it's how","the person says it and I feel like it's very important to pay attention to how the person says it because if you don't then it can cause a lot more","harm than good. It can cause a multitude of issues that wouldn't have been there if you would have just taken the time out to truly listen to what",35,5.1
"35_segment-11","I've never been in a situation where I've needed to relay difficult information, to supervise or a very critical feedback. Because even in my internship I'm not","highly ranked enough to be interested with information or feedback. That would just be very inappropriate for me to have to go to my head boss and be like, Hey","you messed this up because that's not something that an intern should tell someone. Even in my peer group I don't think I would be the one who would have to give","difficult information. If I were in that situation [I would probably], I forget what read about this, I think it's called the Sandwich Method or something. But","you preface the difficult information or critical feedback with like a positive thing, like Oh you did a very nice job on the presentation the other day. And then","critical feedback so you'd be like, But there is this issue with this and you should have done this better and you shouldn't have done this. And then just one","more positive thing you'd say, But overall it was very well done I just think there is some minor tweaks that you make.    I feel like that would be the best way","to relay difficult information or critical feedback because it let's the person know [Hey you did do,] not even Hey you did a good job, it's just I value the","effort you put into it. I value your contributions but there was significant problems with it or there was even minor problems with it.

"35_segment-12","Okay, so every summer I kind of go through a stage where I am extremely all consumingly interested in something just because I have so much free time. So a few summers back it was Greek","methodology, that was skate boarding then there was modern art, just a bunch of random things. But this past summer it was String Theory and I was so, so incredibly into string theory. I","still find it super interesting but nowhere near the level where I was just consumed by it this summer. So one of my sister's knowing that I was just for a little time being I had been so","interested in it and she found it interesting too. She was like, Hey what exactly is this? It sounds really interesting but I don't get it. And of course string theory is one of the most","technical things ever. It's really complicated, really confusing, I still don't know if I completely get it but I told myself I did. So the best way I found to explain this super duper","complex technical thing to her is just say it in layman's terms. So instead of giving her like the super complex technical definition I'd be like, Oh well string theory says that, at the","most basic level instead of molecules, atoms, everything is made up of tiny vibrating strings.   And that gives someone a visual much more so than an actual full complex description of it.","And then I let her borrow this book that I was reading that did the exact same thing. It's like the idiots guide to string theory. And the both of us being idiots about string theory","thought it was just super incredibly helpful. So I feel like giving people information about something that explains it in a way we'll understand is the best way to do that, whether it be","literature or verbal explanation or a diagram or anything. Giving them just concrete resources that they could reference during an explanation or for an explanation are just immensely",35,4.6
"36_segment-01","Sure I'd be happy to provide you uh the information. um In my last position uh as a Database Administrator, um one of the most","challenging um uh situations was to um involve other database administrators while working on any specific problem that impacted","multiple databases.

"37_segment-01","I would say the best job that fits this scenario would be my first internship at the FAA when I worked for ATandT, Advanced Sciences and Technology. I was a junior in high","school and there I was more of a um less experienced, uh amateur in the workforce where there were definitely senior members in the group. And in this internship we had to","perform several tasks which meant uh giving either, giving presentations on or laboratories,um  developing brochures etcetera. So with the senior management we had to take","on several roles such as giving these presentations. So we do not, I did not lead uh myself and another coworker who was on the job with me, we did not lead these","presentations but we had to do our part. So in that we did our best to prepare the brochure, uh to make sure it was well prepared for other senior managers. um In addition","we also partook in several of the um presentations for the labs, um in addition we had roles in working in the back laboratories. um Not really taking on the major roles but","doing the little tasks uh just to, you know do our part.

And the majority of our presentations we had to deliver to other high school college students and also senior managers uh at the FAA which is the Federal Aviation","Technology, I mean Federal Aviation Administration. um It was well received and so from the years on, um from my junior senior year at high school and also my freshman","sophomore year in college uh they continued this uh opportunity for us to um give the presentations because that year was actually our first year of trying it out, so it was",37,4.4
"37_segment-02","I would say this would fall into my senior year at, uh this scenario would fall into my senior year working at uh the Federal Aviation Administration when I was more uh","senior member of the group. And where I had uh younger individuals of my group which were in my same position. And the way I went about instilling this positive uh","enforcement and empowerment was the same way in which my senior members, my first year uh did to me. And so simply that was by uh not delegating but rather uh inquiring and","seeing what people feel comfortable to do and also working with them. Uh So for instance when we would go practice for our presentations it would be me and then allowing them","to uh present the material they would like. Always giving them positive reinforcement, areas in improvement that they would see uh that they could have. And uh it was simply","just positive reinforcement and uh, just positive reinforcement and uh the outcome was uh again it was well received uh from the younger group members. And uh you know from","that, uh from their  first couple uh presentations of our labs, uh in addition they began to take on more roles on new material. Uh Started to introduce our presentations","rather than uh taking a later portion of the presentation. So it allowed them to be a little more confident in public speaking in various groups uh which were senior","managers, college students and also high school students. So uh the outcome was that they were much more confident in the material that they are represent. Also because uh I","also told them the importance of being well prepared, uh making the script of their material more uh suitable and tailored to their needs uh and how they like to speak. So uh",37,6
"37_segment-03","Best scenario that would fit this would not be in the work setting but more with my fraternity. um I'm on the E board and in that uh my uh President and Vice President","of my organization did not really get along to well. um Definitely a clash in, you know motives, goals um delegation and how to run the organization. So the best way","in which I thought that I handled the situation um was to create comfortable environment at our um E board meetings. um A lot of times when we would meet there would","be a lot of um conflict in interest, conflict in um styles of leadership and a lot of times when people would talk they would be talking over one another and it led to","a lot of arguments and definitely no progressive um solution. So one of the best things that I did was simply um propose a way in order to go about uh our meetings","simply raising awareness that everybody has their own strengths. And uh their own strengths and skills um and the best way utilize one of the strengths and skills is","to raise the awareness and listen without judgment, kind of come to the table with a blank ah slate and um be willing to accept what everybody has. And in that you","know it definitely raised the awareness of everybody's strengths um and I would have to say that our organization definitely shot through the roof. We actually had,","you know we were on a decline, our members weren't really coming out, they didn't have too many brothers coming in because we had a lot of seniors graduating.

"37_segment-04","This scenario definitely falls into uh more recent uh situations uh at my school The College of New Jersey I'm in the process of developing a new Interpersonal Organizational Club for my","major in addition to a program.

Um And","simply asking what their uh best advice is, how to go about it and then proposing mine uh in addition to considering what they said. Uh So we can come to an end goal. Because in order to","succeed in this initiative for an Interpersonal Organizational Club and a program to drive that club I definitely need others with uh higher authority who have other skills and","knowledge. So uh the opportunity definitely arose when I learned to, um you know inquire about their interest or needs and then also cater uh my initiatives and ideas to their needs. And","uh it [was very], so Florida is going very well, uh lots of people are on board including Senators of the Communications Department, uh member of the Student Advisory Board which are","both the President and the Vice President, the Chair of the Department and also Chair of the Interpersonal Organizational Club. So all of which are behind this initiative and club uh",37,5.9
"37_segment-05","The scenario that will fall into an incident uh last semester which would be my spring twenty fourteen semester at TCNJ when I was","working in a group project with one of my fraternity brothers and also two other members. Uh And initially it was myself and one","other member and the professor asked myself and one member to bring along my fraternity brother because uh he didn't particularly","think his idea or um his topic would suit the objective um of the class. So with that being said I had to reach out to my fraternity","brother and tell him the scenario um of you know in a um light and um sincere way. Um And uh with that I kind of introduce that, uh","the professor was very excited about our idea and uh he'd be willing to help us out uh moving forward because there's something new","which was uh uh the Canadian pipeline uh which started from Canada and rode down all the way down to Mexico uh and uh I mentioned","that he would be willing to help us and that uh I told my fraternity brother which is Tom Pellogrino that uh if he came along with","us it would definitely help us uh moving forward and um help us solidify a good grade in the end. So with that he actually joined","our group and uh we had a collective effort, lots of help from our professor and at the end we are all satisfied with our grade in",37,4.6
"37_segment-06","This past summer I received an internship opportunity and a job opportunity uh that would take place in Manhattan. uh I was facilitating for a uh diversity inclusion initiative for the employees of Cox Media Group.","And in that I was very excited and basically told my mother uh that I would be taking on this internship which we were taking in Manhattan. And her concern was I would not be able to handle my school work um let","alone my obligations with my fraternity and take on every other obligations that I had. So uh what I did was I realized the way that my mother prefers to think, she's a very analytical person, she is a uh senior","manager for the FAA. And so she's very organized, she'd like to see that I have a plan, uh step by step process. And so what I did was um introduce her with a proposal, uh basically clearing all the concerns she","had. And number one concern was that, uh me handling my school with additional fifteen hour requirement for my internship which would take place in Manhattan. um Handling uh the Spanish, which was something new to","us taking on this year, it's required for my class. And, um uh yeah so those were two of the concerns and so what I simply did was I gave her a proposal uh clearing all those. Mentioning that last year I had a job,","giving about six and a half hours, in additional to my school work and my obligation with the fraternity. um And also the fact that I have three days off of school this semester um which would take place of my","internship so I would have plenty of time to get my school work done. And since I you know flexed too her taking preference and her communication style, uh at the end she was, you know speechless, had no questions.","And from then on it has been um very easy transition, uh not stressful at all, she doesn't call me worrying about um my school work or anything. Because from now on I've realized that any time she has a concern","with anything that I'm taking on I simply approach her with a proposal uhclearing all the concerns that she had. So uh the outcome is uh definitely a peace of mind and um peace of mind and handling my school work",37,6.4
"37_segment-07","Last semester I had a group project with my fraternity brother and in which we got along fine but the thing was we had different intentions for our outcome in the class. So with that being said when it came time for um","deadlines, handing in certain assignments, um and basically meeting with the group uh there was definitely a gap in communication. So one of the things that I began to do was simply um meet with him one on one and also","give little reminders uh  and offer help uh whenever he needed. Um And also one of the things that I did was kind of cater to his uh needs so that we could you know get the job done and get a good grade in the class.","Uh And one of the ways that I did that was ask for his schedule, uh opportunities when he could meet up or opportunities when he could do the work so that I was able to meet with him and help him out with the","assignment. And the way I interacted with him was not necessarily delegating or uh telling him what to do but simply um asking questions and saying what worked for him. uh Basically flexing to his needs, his","preference, um which was,you know which worked out very well. There was def definitely some bumps and bruises along when he wouldn't hand in the, you know hand in or send me material when he said he would. uh [And the","way I would go about that is not simply,] I wouldn't get mad or take it out on frustrations. Simply asking with questions,uh kind of like a um um allow him to think about what he's doing for the entire group. um Simply","things like you know 'our grade rests on you?'um If you're you know not gonna get it on time that's gonna, you know affect us, if you can't do it just simply let us know uh so that we can you know help you out, um","anyway it is a group effort. So um the outcome was uh it worked well, we definitely had some bumps and bruises but um the style I learned was simply just from another self help book which was um 'the seven habits of","highly effective people.' So just simply implementing some of those skills learned there uh definitely helped me out with uh managing different thinking styles and preferences within our group um and the outcome was we",37,6.2
"37_segment-08","Last semester at TCNJ I worked for a department called MTSS Media Technology Supporter Systems. Which [we basically took care of all of the] uh we trouble shot all the issues in the classrooms, whether","it be the computers weren't starting up right, the projectors were malfunctioning uh anything of that nature, anything technology based uh on the entire campus, we took care of it. And in that there was","a lot of tedious boring, uh not necessarily physically demanding tasks but uh definitely tedious because at our job site we were able to do work and uh to be hit with a media call at the help desk to go","do it was definitely uh something that was um a little aggravating to say the least. And uh in that we had one member of our group was more of a senior member but she was as well a college student. And","whenever there were assigned tasks she always assigned every one of us, rarely did she ever go out and do that. So one of the best way I just simply did it was um offer to her if she could go do it","sometimes when I wasn't able to do it. Um you know I figured out it never hurts to ask so whenever I figured that I had been doing plenty of jobs during my day I put in my share, um because I was able","to, you know, know which task I did, what other tasks everybody else did because we had a board with assignments and we would write our names down. Basically assigned it so I would see who hadn't done","any and I would just simply propose that um whoever hasn't done the most work should probably go get the assigned task. So I would just simply ask and inquire they would be uh um be able to do which","would be our senior management from time to time. Um and most of the time she had no problem or issue doing it and so that definitely freed up more time and released some stress um and um allowed me to","get more work done during my uh during my work hours. So um the outcome was that we all were able to um put in the same effort in our job which definitely should be the end goal so there no tension or",37,5.3
"37_segment-09","This scenario definitely falls more into my fraternity organization as a individual member rather than a group project. Uh When one of the members was, uh not the Vice President but he","was the Treasurer of our organization and their current Vice President wasn't really, uh you know uh he wasn't uh performing to uh definitely the best of his abilities or the role that","his job uh demanded in that one of our members that was the Treasurer took his position. Uh Which in return um definitely uh interfered with uh several of his philosophies, because the","guy who was his, you know his, uh the current Vice President was one of his best friends. And uh definitely there was some guilt, uh some struggle because we had a problem how to uh","approach the situation. So the best way I handled the situation was uh basically raised awareness that we were doing it for the best interest of our fraternity brother and also the","best interest of our entire organization. So um if anybody was in a situation that was not bettering themselves or the people that they were, um you know the people that they were","responsible for than as a neighbor we definitely should have taken action uh which was the right way. And not to feel guilty about it but understand that this was for the best interest","and we were doing it for uh uh a common good for both our fraternity brother and our entire organization. Uh Which definitely uh went extremely well, there was no regrets, our brother","uh that resigned from the Vice President position still comes to all of our, um still comes to all of the chapter meetings. Uh He attends all social events, come to all of our uh","philanthropy events and so uh in that return there organization runs very smoothly.

"37_segment-10","So fall into [a], uh plenty of scenarios that would happened at my previous job at MTSS, we need a technician, uh","support system at The College of New Jersey. In that, I had to uh definitely uh heighten my awareness and","listening skills when it came to uh solving problems and solutions within certain classrooms. Uh and also working","with other group members uh there was a lot of technical and procedural message that went into a lot of uh our","assignments. And so uh with that being said there was definitely a level of confusion. So moving forward I","definitely had to uh raise the awareness of my listening skills and uh I also utilized the uh importance of","technology, writing down a lot of things, writing down a lot of the thing I heard or sometimes even recording","thing just for uh reference when it came to uh taking on the certain tasks. And um uh the outcome was that over","time it definitely took a little bit of uh time to get used to all of the technical and procedural methods but","over time uh through repetition and consecutively going out to these jobs uh I got into the hang of things and uh",37,4.6
"37_segment-11","My two thousand thirteen summer uh job at the FAA Federal Aviation Administration, ran into um a situation when I was working with several of my group, some of who","were college students, some of who were high school students. um And in there one of the members said a uh racial comment which was definitely not suitable for the","workplace. It didn't necessarily offend me but I uh thought about uh how this could positively or negatively impact other members in the organization, not to","mentions uh that member had a uh mother who worked in the workplace so I just thought that would not go well um if that information got out. So I simply uh","contacted my direct report who had, um who was in direct contact with uh our boss.

And so from then on it","went to a meeting with me, uh my direct report and also our boss. And what I did was in the situation uh told her what happened and additionally um empathized uh","with my other coworkers uh who were full time employees there.

"37_segment-12","uh This summer it was my internship I was teaching a content uh for Cox Communication Group, one of which was uh thinking preferences. Which can be on a very complex, a lot of tech,","uh very complex um information, uh different areas of the brain, um cerebral cortex, limbic uh area, all of which our audience was not very familiar with, um even if some were, some","weren't. So what we had to do is uh cater the material towards them using uh several terms providing uh visuals so that they can have a better understanding. So we understood that","some people prefer bullet points, some people prefer visual stacks. um So we simply um catered to all their needs, did activities that were interactive because some people um","definitely understand more um content when they're interacting. um When they're interacting some people do well when they have the hard, you know faster material in front of the face","which is something we did as well. In addition we also provided them with visual so that they can understand and have a visual presentation of the material. And the outcome was uh the","initiative was well received, they understand all of the content.

"38_segment-01","Early on in my career before I moved into management I worked as a facilitator uh for continuous improvement problem solving teams. My job there was to assist the team","leader in getting his team through a problem solving process. I would have the expertise as far as problem solving message, group dynamics, that type of thing and I would","then facilitate the group. Initially influence in the group was very strong until they started to become a more effective unit. Once they started becoming effective my job","became more observational um uh as far as the general behavior of the group was concerned. I would look for critical intervention points or things where the group needed","uh something to help as far as the dynamics were concerned. um In a number of the projects uh the idea was there was some kind of a critical situation that they needed to","address to overcome a problem with a client or contract. uh What we were able to do is by using good problem solving methodology, collecting data and then analyzing that","effectively.    The teams would have the technical expertise to then carry the solution through to fulfillment. uh I did this for about ten years, um most of the teams","were extremely successful uh achieving their desired results. uh The biggest problem that we had, the funny part is the biggest problem that we had was once the teams","became effective and became good functional unit they didn't want to terminate. So then we had to deal with the issues of how do you kill off an effective problem solving","team? But in most cases it was very effective, the leader would take the responsibility for the group. I was then responsible just for the um function of the group while",38,5.7
"38_segment-02","uh Great question. uh I am a manager now and I have responsibility for motivating or maintaining a spirit of uh excitement in my work force. um I'll tell you a little story","that um happened early on in my background. When I was learning continuous improvement I had mentors who were specialists in groups dynamics and that type of thing. And one","of them, uh Peter Shoulders, was a specialist who had a presentation on group dynamics and specifically this one was uh addressing motivation. And so the seminar started out","with us going back and forth and he said, We'd like you to uh work together at your table and think about the worst job you ever had. What were the types of things that came","up with that? And generally what happened is people commented about busy work, uh not having to think about things uh being belittled, uh not being respected, not given a","challenge, not having excitement.    And so when people talked about the worst jobs they've ever had these were common traits. And when they were asked to then talk about","the most exciting jobs they've ever had uh the ideas came up with whatever I was working on was important, I had the trust of my uh supervisor, It was an exciting challenge,","he dared me to think. So the idea in motivation is more so in trying to bring that level of excitement, that level of interest, uh trust, importance and helping people to","grow and become more effective at what they do. So motivation isn't so much something that you do financially as much as it is presenting an operational situation where","people believe they have an opportunity to succeed through doing important work and uh that it's not just the busy work, to getting the use their head and they're valued as",38,6.3
"38_segment-03","This is an interesting question. Uh There are situations where I've been either a member of a group or I've been a supervisor of personnel who didn't get along. I'll","tell you briefly about the one where I was a supervisor personnel and I had two people that were constantly going back and forth. Initially uh I had gone through some","training activities where people said uh we need to talk about uh communicating methods. When do you do this, I feel because, I wish you would, and that type of","thing. And run those exercises, I tried that and I found that one of the people in that uh competitive situation actually worked that to their advantage to try and","make things worse. Uh So that exercise although was well meaning uh actually failed miserably. So uh funny part is the bickering continued so uh what I actually did","was uh I used uh a mutual destructive type of an approach, I just simply explained to them that the bickering and the battling couldn't go on anymore and quite","frankly I didn't care who started it or who was responsible for it.    If it continues I was going to relieve them both of their positions and actually that stopped","the problem. In teams that I've been uh a member and worked where we've had situations where people didn't particularly get along I would try and keep us focused on","whatever the objective was in the team. Uh I would work on uh staying focused on using the tools that were explained to use to use. I would try and keep this focused","on individual steps and missions and take opportunities uh where the two would become uh competitive out of that activity and try and develop an area where we'd stay",38,4.9
"38_segment-04","It's uh another interesting question and very appropriate for my current responsibilities. Uh As an executive director of quality I have to try and influence","with different working groups to adopt uh best methods and techniques uh to improve their operation and performance. Uh Of course in most cases where an outside","uh source of information were not necessarily part of the group, so the trust issue plays a large factor in the uh process. Uh We have to take the time to uh","explain what we would like to accomplish, why we believe this would benefit them, what uh would be involved with the activities. Uh We try and reinforce the uh","sense of leadership responsibilities in their organization that uh try and reinforce the idea that the control is still with them while at the same time you're","trying to move ahead on uh a mission. Uh    Sometimes it works really well, sometimes it doesn't work very well, uh but the idea is you still have to accomplish","the objectives and you constantly have to rethink the situation, look for opportunities where you might be putting yourself at risk or damaging that trust","relationship with the leaders. Uh Sometimes you have to reach out and uh ask them what's going on, uh We seem to be having difficulties with this, what can we do","to get past this? Uh I don't know that there's ever a petty answer on how this can be approached but uh in most cases I've been very successful. Usually it works","much better when there's a sense of urgency, then you can take advantage of that situation. Where there's not as greater sense of urgency it's not as easy an",38,5.5
"38_segment-05","I mean my line of work, uh quality and continuous improvement uh negotiating, compromising is uh pretty much a fact of life. uh","Our job is to help people see what is going on, understand the nature of the problem, try and develop solutions and move forward","on that. A lot of the times uh they may perceive it as a risk, uh a threat to their security, uh a threat to a position and their","incomes. So we have to be sensitive to that as we're working through this type of activity. um What I usually try and do is","recognize the common goal and address that, understand what their concerns are, present opportunities where we might be able to","approach it from a certain way. Or just recognize that um our work to uh keep them safe through the process, that we'll do what's","only required that we've agreed to do. um Reinforce with them that uh they have some control in the way this is going to come out","and try and make sure that they understand that they have a much greater participatory role in the activity than they would","initially think. And that people although they were asking for corrective actions weren't asking for something that was","particularly unfair or unwarranted. So once we get that sense of agreement we try and work forward on that and usually we've been",38,6.4
"38_segment-06","Again in my responsibilities in quality and continuous improvement, trying to persuade uh people to uh move in a certain direction is a way of life in my","operation. It's been one of my responsibilities whether as a facilitator or whether as a manager or even today as a director. Uh Usually what we try and do","is figure out uh what the situation is, uh how we might best to identify some opportunities uh uh developing value or interest with the organization. Uh We","try and outline simply what would be involved in the proposal. Uh We would try and explain the long-term benefits of this activity, we would try and identify","some of the needs for why we move forward on this. Uh if we have data it's worth it's weight in gold, if you can put it on a chart it's even more valuable.","Uh Tables of numbers aren't as usually understood as charts and graphs are.    Charts and graphs do a tremendous job of transmitting a lot of the information","in a very short period of time. Uh so if you want to expose situations or ideas, charts and graphs are very effective in helping to make this happen. Uh I've","had a variety of uh results from overwhelming successes where people just caught onto it immediately and carried out on the uh proposal. And I've had","situations where uh we've proposed this grand scheme and activity and uh as it turns out we've had to take it piecemeal, a little bit at a time get a","concession of willingness to try something going forward. Uh And then hopefully you stay focused, you stay disciplined, you remember the long-term objectives",38,6.6
"38_segment-07","It's a challenging and interesting question. um From time to time you always run into somebody that you don't particularly uh care for or","you won't necessarily get along with. um I usually find that um I'm very easy to work with. I usually like working with most people. uh","Sometimes there's no accounting for the interactions of other persons, they may have a separate agenda, they may have different","objectives. What I try to do is I try and stay focused on what we're trying to accomplish in the long run. Again I try and focus on","commonality of effort, uh commonality of objectives and goals. um I try not to get emotionally involved in the activities, uh you uh stay","focused on what you're trying to accomplish. uh You don't necessarily have to be liked to uh move forward on what you're trying to","accomplish, so I try and stay focused on what it is, I try and stay pleasant. uh I use normal um greetings, how are you doing? Hello, uh","say good morning to when you see them. uh I try and stay out of a personal type of conversations and things that I guess that's a bit","defensive, but uh personal issues aren't necessarily important to uh accomplish in what you're trying to work with in the long run with","that person. So I just try and keep it professional, stay focused on what we're trying to do and uh stay polite and uh just working on it",38,5.4
"38_segment-08","Uh it's funny, uh there's not very many things that I've come into uh contact with that were particularly unpleasant or demanding uh","tasks. You know sometimes things that are repetitive or uh could be boring and uh sometimes they are tough to accomplish, but uh I've","always tried to approach things from the idea of whatever I'm working on I try to do to the best of my ability, I try and stay","positive when I'm working on it. Uh you have times when you can talk to your supervisors about what's going on, uh usually I take","pride in doing whatever I'm working on well and as well as I possibly can. If there's a running joke,'if they ask you to make copies","you be the best copy maker in the business' and uh try and improve your uh reputation by being the best at whatever it is they're","asking you to do. Uh Sometimes uh you understand that a lot of times extra things will be uh given to you because you may be the most","capable person doing that work, and sometimes the supervisor will uh dump a little bit more on your plate because they believe you're","capable of doing it and that they need to succeed in the long run. So you can always talk to your supervisor about the distribution","of work, but my uh basic approach is do it as well as you possibly can and be the best at it uh that you can while you actually do",38,6.3
"38_segment-09","um This hasn't happened very often to start with. um I have been exposed to one or two situations where there's been new leadership that's come","in to an organization. um And they um appear to have been going off in a different direction that what the uh original process might have","indicated and I have seen situations where uh they seem to express a certain opinion or direction that they choose to pursue and have ignored uh","information or ideas that didn't necessarily agree with their decision. um You try and understand where they are coming from, uh you ask","questions, you try and learn what going on, what's the motivation. Maybe they have information that you're not aware of, um so first of all you","seek to understand uh the situation, understand their thinking, what are they up against? um And then if there's uh information that you think","would be beneficial to uh present to them, I always try and present it in a database solutions with, uh and I said before charts or graphs.","Charts or graphs are tremendous in taking the uh personality of the argument out of it. uh There's something that's remarkably freeing about","charts and graphs where people see information and they go, I had no idea, or, That's something I hadn't thought about, or, How long has this","been going on? They, a lot of times what you'll see is um a surprise when you're working on data, and again, it takes a lot of the personality",38,5.4
"38_segment-10","Listening skills, uh this is pretty good. uh This is also a learning activity that I went through very early on in my career. I used to be uh  when I was much,","much younger uh very cocky and arrogant and confident and believed that I had the only right answers and that uh I just couldn't understand why people didn't","see the brilliance of whatever I was thinking about. um And then uh I was fortunate enough to go through a lot of training where uh we were learning to be","facilitators of groups where listening skills were a core element in the training activities. And the uh training that went back and forth was on understanding","the nature of communications that um if you're thinking about a response or you're thinking about a way to come back at some kind of comment that someone's","making first of all you're not listening and hearing what they are saying uh so it's important to listen to what the conversation is going on.    uh Also part","of good listening is being able to ask questions to learn more and understand better uh the situation that you're dealing with. um We only have a certain","limited amount of exposure to situations uh held on a personal basis so uh the more questions we seek to understand the situation the more effective we can be.","Also when you're practicing listening and asking for input and asking for information you're drawing that person into a common relationship. And building their","sense of importance in the conversation um and you in fact do uh improve their uh position in the relationship. So it makes you in a much more effective um",38,5.6
"38_segment-11","Uh It's an interesting, this whole interview could have been focused on my job responsibilities. In quality we always have opportunities where uh we're going to","have to communicates some difficult information or we may have some critical feedback that needs to be uh managed up if you will. Uh Usually what I try and do if I","have to do that is recognize that first of all uh it's important to my supervisor or manager to uh have the information that I might uh have. So they're protected","and knowledgeable and they are able to deal with it if they're asked about it. [That], uh there's nothing worse than getting caught with your pants down, so you","have to realize that some of this information and some of this feedback may be very helpful to them in the long run and that we have a responsibility to provide","that information. Usually what I'll try and do is uh explain that uh we have an issue, we talk about it, uh I'll explain the background in the situation, what the","uh negative information or the difficult feedback is and then ask them how that they want to deal with it.    Is is there anything I can do to support them in","carrying on in addressing the situation? But uh I believe uh providing difficult information or critical feedback is absolutely necessary. Uh Again you don't want","your boss to be caught unaware in another meeting where someone else might challenge them on this exact information that you have. You can't just hide it, if you","fail uh at something that's also true. You know sometimes you just blow it and you have to let them know that that situation came about. You can't hide it, you",38,5.6
"38_segment-12","um Statistical process control is sometimes considered a very complex or technical type of an issues, and a lot of times the people that you are dealing","with although they work in processes aren't necessarily aware of how statistical process control would work. uh And the fact of the matter is they don't","necessarily need to know how it works. The idea is you need to be able to take uh complex ideas down to a nontechnical uh level. You can talk about um a","normal distribution but you can talk about it in a Bell curve. You don't have to talk about modes of uh distribution, you can say, The top of the hill.","uh Standard deviation you can talk about the formula but the reality is is they just need to know uh a normal curve is defined by standard deviation","since standard deviation is just a standard measure that we are able to talk about and apply across uh different uh mediums. But to do that, it's a lot","easier to do it with graphs and charts. uh Simple things that aren't too challenging. Again you try and relate it to the activities that we're talking","about, put it in common terms that they're familiar with um and explain how it relates to their activity. um A process performance is actually a","behavior so if you can talk about the way that the processes is behaving over time they don't need to know that there's a lot of variation going on and","there's special causes of variation. You can, talking about an unusual event and understand that once the unusual event was gone well I'm running out of",38,4.6

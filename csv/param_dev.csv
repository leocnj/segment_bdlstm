","And in most cases, there hasn't been much persuasion required because I'm in a technical area of ETS. Because uh well in many cases things I've suggested were not accepted for reasons that had nothing to do with the statistical advantages or disadvantages of it. Something about writing across the curriculum, and to my utter and complete amazement the President of ETS decided to go with the single forty-five minute essay. Disregarding the advice from both her statisticians and her lawyers, and at that point I began to lose my faith in the judgment of ETS's President.","And there's not a great deal of persuasion required. Because uh well in many cases things I've suggested were not accepted for reasons that had nothing to do with the statistical advantages or disadvantages of it. And the question was whether or not a certain test should have a single sixty minute, a single forty-five minute essay or three fifteen minute essays.

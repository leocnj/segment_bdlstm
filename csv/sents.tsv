01_segment-01	Okay this is according to when I was working at ATandT that um we had to come up with an application that was used for uh small group interactions like you would call someone and another person and the third person. And uh what I decided at the early out set because I didn't want this to the one of those projects that happened at ATandT a lot, which is to just to spiral into nowhere. uh And so I did that because like I said I wanted to see And for the most part I helped bring that, I believe I helped bring that uh entire project to close and they did actually create a product and try it out. It was again this experimental product but they did do that, so um [it was], I don't normally like to be a leader but again I just didn't feel like I was going to waste my time on a project which happened at ATandT a lot.	uh The application had a small like uh sort of guide to look up peoples name etcetera. And on my job was at the time I was doing human factors which is ease of use and I was also doing some web design too so there was some design elements there as well. And started to distribute that teams of developers, to the and artist etcetera. uh Even there was a marketing person on the team. , I thought it was a great project and I wanted to see it go at least close to close.	Okay this is according to when I was working at ATandT that um we had to come up with an application that was used for uh small group interactions like you would call someone and another person and the third person.

Was I started to create prototypes very early on that were interactive. And started to distribute that teams of developers, to the and artist etcetera. uh Even there was a marketing person on the team. uh And so I did that because like I said I wanted to see It was again this experimental product but they did do that, so um [it was], I don't normally like to be a leader but again I just didn't feel like I was going to waste my time on a project which happened at ATandT a lot.	uh The problems was that uh it was very forward looking so it was like a group of people loosely brought together and there really wasn't a leader in that uh condition. Was I started to create prototypes very early on that were interactive. uh Even there was a marketing person on the team. uh And so I did that because like I said I wanted to see And for the most part I helped bring that, I believe I helped bring that uh entire project to close and they did actually create a product and try it out.

Was I started to create prototypes very early on that were interactive. uh Even there was a marketing person on the team. And uh so by doing that a lot of people would bounce all the ideas off of me, the developers would come to me with their designs afterwards to make sure they match with uh what I was designing. It was again this experimental product but they did do that, so um [it was], I don't normally like to be a leader but again I just didn't feel like I was going to waste my time on a project which happened at ATandT a lot.

01_segment-02	So this was sort of like a phase two part of the project uh So all the other analysts were put on there and I was a given all of TOEFL uh and all of the systems analysts. That was close to eighteen people uh reporting back to me. And there was also a lot of uh frustration amongst uh these systems analysts because they were right at the forefront uh to get everything done in time so I would say morale wasn't exactly high. And then provide reinforcement and also be a buffer whenever it was needed. And we got everything out in time so it was a good success.
	And uh it had already launched but there was a huge amount of development we still had to do on it because we need to get it out at a certain point. There were five lead business analysts and each business analyst had four or five people assigned to them, uh systems analysts if you will. That helps with the whole work aspect, the amount of emails I got etcetera and timing we spent was cut down drastically. So that was sort of phase one of my solution, the second thing was of course to deal with the uh morale. And that was a little trickier because there were people who were not getting along with each other, people who were etcetera, but I also had to go by their skills set. And then provide reinforcement and also be a buffer whenever it was needed.	So all the other analysts were put on there and I was a given all of TOEFL uh and all of the systems analysts. Uh So one of the things, the first thing of it of course was I had my own job to do, I still had to do the business analyst part and I had to do it for all the missing business analysts. So the first thing I did of course was to delegate and I created a structure, so who reported to whom etcetera. So all I had to do, what I had to do is sacrifice a little bit of my own time and make sure I was in those team meetings and those group meetings a lot. And then provide reinforcement and also be a buffer whenever it was needed. And we got everything out in time so it was a good success.
	When I was working here uh in my fourth or fifth year we were bringing TOEFL, new TOEFL out to the market.

When I was working here uh in my fourth or fifth year we were bringing TOEFL, new TOEFL out to the market. And uh at that time they also decide set up a multi program type of registration system. So the first thing I did of course was to delegate and I created a structure, so who reported to whom etcetera. That helps with the whole work aspect, the amount of emails I got etcetera and timing we spent was cut down drastically. But then there were two other teams that I dealt with some conflicts.

So uh I managed to put together four teams that were working very well, probably only needed about maybe an hour's worth of my time every week. But then there were two other teams that I dealt with some conflicts.	When I was working here uh in my fourth or fifth year we were bringing TOEFL, new TOEFL out to the market.

01_segment-03	So um in that case at first it was difficult because I was getting inundated with private emails from both of them. They weren't but they were just sticking points that they were getting stuck on so I just 'called the shots' type of situation.	uh In the example I was just giving, um in two of the teams I said there was some personality problems, I do recall specifically two people in one team that could not get along at all because they both came at every problem from opposite sides and just continued to argue back and forth, but they were both very good at what they were doing. uh And needed to be within that function that they were working on because that's where their expertise was. So I had to take as I said before a more active involvement in meetings with them and I had to deal with certain occasions, was just um to pull one aside at some point and say Look I've read what you have, it's valid but we're going with the other.	uh In the example I was just giving, um in two of the teams I said there was some personality problems, I do recall specifically two people in one team that could not get along at all because they both came at every problem from opposite sides and just continued to argue back and forth, but they were both very good at what they were doing. uh And needed to be within that function that they were working on because that's where their expertise was.

I would just say That's the way we're doing it, that makes decisions as if they were momentously important.	uh In the example I was just giving, um in two of the teams I said there was some personality problems, I do recall specifically two people in one team that could not get along at all because they both came at every problem from opposite sides and just continued to argue back and forth, but they were both very good at what they were doing. uh And needed to be within that function that they were working on because that's where their expertise was. So when I called for one or the other they went along with it and things calmed down pretty quickly.

01_segment-04	One of the things I'm most proud about uh starting here at ETS and then all the time I've been here, is the ability to have the trust of the uh business stake holders, SBU's we call them, uh in TOEFL. So the business unit itself is very often under pressure. And um what I did was I approached it very simply as I have as sort of a usability expert, is the first thing you need to do is find out what's wrong. Have people run through things and listen and look and watch and get all the information you could about where the major problems are, where in the user interface. So if we were going to have a delay they knew about it and they knew why. And um I think they're very satisfied with my performance.
	One of the things I'm most proud about uh starting here at ETS and then all the time I've been here, is the ability to have the trust of the uh business stake holders, SBU's we call them, uh in TOEFL. It's a very high pressured uh program because we do provide a lot of the money that ETS makes, there's competition in the field etcetera. Well you do what needs to be done to gain their trust. uh Always, I always made sure that every response back was completely truthful.

I never tried to hide anything because I think in the past they were being misled was something they didn't like as well. So if we were going to have a delay they knew about it and they knew why.

01_segment-05	Being a business analyst you're forever trying to compromise, you have business needs and then you have development requirements needs as well. Uh the best thing to do in those situations when I have to work and try to come out with something that both sides are happy with, of course is just take the problem, break it down first. So if the business comes and they say We have a need. So I can at least boil it down to that. Uh or if they understand what the difficulties that have to be surmounted.	So the business wants certain work to be done but then it has to fit into a development schedule. And uh sometimes what's seen as one side is very easy, either, well you can change the requirement or the other side as well or we can just do X. Uh turns out to be very complicated. That gives me more options when I work with development, because they can suggest different solutions and I can go back to again the business. And you really will find that you get by and very quickly from people when they understand what's at stake.

Getting people to buy into a proposal I have um, it's difficult to narrow that down to one specific instance because it happens often.

01_segment-07	Because they have certain character traits that's the opposite of mine I could just dismiss them more readily. With you doesn't make a difference as long as you get a good job done no one is really going to care in the end. And uh very often all the projects we work on are a short term. I think if it was something where for instance someone had to work with consistently, the manager or something like that. I mean that's the best way to do it, is keep everything and allow it to a professional level.	Uh Sometimes it was because of the personality of the individual and sometimes I realize it was just because of a mix of personalities between myself and the individual.

	But there are people I've worked with which have been exceptionally difficult to deal with.

Because they have certain character traits that's the opposite of mine I could just dismiss them more readily. But there are people I've worked with which have been exceptionally difficult to deal with. And uh as I've learned over the years is the best thing to do is sigh privately uh and just keep your eyes on the goal of what you're trying to do on the project. I think if it was something where for instance someone had to work with consistently, the manager or something like that. [I would have to], you have ways to escalate etcetera.	Uh Sometimes it was because of the personality of the individual and sometimes I realize it was just because of a mix of personalities between myself and the individual. Because they have certain character traits that's the opposite of mine I could just dismiss them more readily. I mean that's the best way to do it, is keep everything and allow it to a professional level. And uh let all the irritation out when you get home, uh ride the bike or something like that, that's all I could say. Uh

	I got some unpleasant tasks, uh no likes when you have a lot of the, tedious boring ones but you can get to those.

01_segment-10	uh Part of the problem they had was communication with the IT groups and so one of the things I did as I said is I went I sat down with all the members team individually. So if somebody said, uh mentioned the phrase So because they all have like, if they all have that common complaint. So that's what I had done and that's what I sort of continue to do, just keep the ear open for those things.
	And to get to more a detailed level uh what I really did in the listening part of it was I actually listened for I think I call them catch phrases or phrases that were repeated over and over from person to person, Was it just personally somebody just sat on them or was it because we didn't have a good process, whatever it was.

And uh by doing that as I've mentioned before really solved  a lot of the problems and a lot of them had to do with uh um lateness of response to  requests, and part of that of course is knowing what are the important requests and what aren't important.

[That isn't], the important thing is to simply say A cannot communicate with B. And I mean that's just the central message, or that um uh if information is going to go from one system to another, we've got to completely change what the layouts and formats are because the informations are different. Again it's always what the reasons or what the effects are and what the reasons are but not trying to get mired into details because that's what happens sometimes. I've been guilty of that myself.

 

  um Let's see.

 

  Because question one is.

 

 	Again it's always what the reasons or what the effects are and what the reasons are but not trying to get mired into details because that's what happens sometimes. People go down to such a detailed level and you lose your audience um uh because people are to busy trying to find out and understand those details when that may not be the important thing. Of course if the technical detail is important, it's critical. You can go and spend time in that one detail but assuming here that were talking about trying to get to the understanding of a system or complexity, so that's how I've done it. I know I've forgotten sometimes it's not on mute. Isn't this the same thing?

 

  Okay if it went back to the beginning of the prompts then yes.
	Going from legacy to the new system etcetera and why System A can directly communicate with System B etcetera. [That isn't], the important thing is to simply say A cannot communicate with B. And I mean that's just the central message, or that um uh if information is going to go from one system to another, we've got to completely change what the layouts and formats are because the informations are different. People go down to such a detailed level and you lose your audience um uh because people are to busy trying to find out and understand those details when that may not be the important thing. Whose ever on the phone and typing could you mute your side, that's the most common uh .

 

  I know I've forgotten sometimes it's not on mute. Okay if it went back to the beginning of the prompts then yes.
	um There have been a number of times where I had had to take something that I've gotten say from the IT side uh as an explanation of why we could uh do something but it was going to be very complex, although it seems simple. And present that to the business and um in all fairness it isn't that the business wouldn't understand some of the complexity but my goal was not to get into technical detail but to get more into the reasons on what we should do.

I work out what is at the high level for each of the box of things I need to go over.

04_segment-01	So I sort of mapped out for the group what I thought the grid would look like and over the next actually almost two years we played around with this grid.

So we sort of had to get them to focus and I tried to do that uh personally with them uh to make sure that we were going to meet our objectives and finish this project.
	Uh And I think that really uh the, the contract people had much more investment in this because we were the ones who had to make sure that everything got to the right place when it was all done. Uh But the amount of time and effort that it takes to put the purchase order together is usually much less than the contract manager job. So we sort of had to get them to focus and I tried to do that uh personally with them uh to make sure that we were going to meet our objectives and finish this project.
	Uh the procurement people have a much lesser role of, they obviously put together the purchase order, that's very important to uh the external supplier. Uh And I guess I spent a fair amount of time trying to talk with them about the work that they do, uh ask them how they do the work, how they should, how they felt they could interface with us and what they thought the good outcome would be uh so that we could all come to a conclusion that would work for both groups. So we sort of had to get them to focus and I tried to do that uh personally with them uh to make sure that we were going to meet our objectives and finish this project.

04_segment-05	I was asked to work on a contract with one of our accounting firms um for some work that they were going to be doing overseas for us, and what happened was they gave me a copy of their contract um and asked, I was asked to look at it but not spend a lot of time on it and not make a lot of changes to it because our internal finance people really just wanted to get this signed. Um and I actually had to negotiate that with my internal client because I had a meeting that morning and I couldn't get this finished until the afternoon. And I think probably about five of them were actually accepted by the accounting firm. Um interestingly there were some typos in what the finance people thought was the final agreement and so I pointed out to them where these typos were because I though if this goes up to the vice president and the vice president sees these mistakes I'm going to be blamed for it.	Um So I said to them, Well you know, I really need to read the whole thing over and give you my comments. And I talked to my senior director about this and we agreed that I would do my normal job of reviewing everything.

But anyway I ended up giving them feedback on ten different pieces of the contract that um my director and I thought were important.	I'll point out all the items that we thought we important and then the finance people would decide which ones they really wanted to go back to the, the accounting firm on.

	And uh in the past uh when I was working on those letters I sometimes had to negotiate with our Rabbi or with our Kantra on what some of the wording would be, um how we were going to put this together.

04_segment-07	Uh and when I worked at City Group, I worked for about six months under a person who uh came to us on Halloween and we decided that she was a witch. Uh that was kind of the only way that I could get through working with her because I'm a person who likes very much to have organization and I felt like I couldn't work on three things at once uh in the way that she wanted me to do because I wasn't going to get them all done at the same time. Uh so anyway uh there was one day when uh this person asked me to update some PowerPoint presentations that I had previously done, and I asked her when she needed them and she said she needed them that day, including some new ones that I hadn't ever worked on before. So that was kind of interesting, uh but I felt like I was very much freed from uh captivity when I wasn't having to work with her anymore.
	and we decided that she was a witch. Uh and what we found was she always thought that she was right about everything. Uh she worked about twenty five hours everyday and expected the rest of us to do that as well, and uh she watched over us, made comments that we stayed at lunch too long or left work on what she thought was early when actually it was not usually early. Uh so what I did was just use my best judgment in that case to try to get things done as quickly as I could uh and hand them over to her and say, you know, Here we are, this one is done. Uh but I was really proud of myself that I got them all done in the time frame that she requested and I realized the next day when I was down sized that the reason that Donna needed all of this stuff was that I wasn't going to be there anymore and she wanted it all finished before I left.

04_segment-08	So we finally uh were told that we were going to have a file cleanup day, and I got really nervous about this because we were each going to be given uh a shelf of files and that meant that my files were interspersed among all of the people who were going to do this project and I was a little bit nervous about what was going to happen to the files that I'm responsible for. So the first thing that I did was I ran into the file room, I grabbed all my really important files, I put them on my desk and I said, I'll do these myself. um And then on the day of file cleanup we had all of our instructions, what we were supposed to do. um And I spent the day working on this, I thought that it was going to take about two hours to do the file room cleanup, my part of it, but it actually took the entire day and we almost didn't finish by the end of the day um which was kind of scary.

	um She never listened to any of the ideas that I had and I sort of sat around, sat in the room looking around realizing that nobody else was ever making any suggestions and that they were kind of the Stepford Wives.

There could be other things that we could do with it. um What Bill and I did before that was we knew that everything was set in the DocuSign system but we sat down just the two of us and rehearsed how we were going to do this, exactly what order we were going to do it in, how he and I would show the different pieces of the system and the different um uh people who would be involved and how they would fill out the forms electronically.

And all of our contracts go through the DocuSign system to be fully executed and it's great because in the end everybody can get a copy of, um everybody who you want to can get a copy of the executed agreement. um What we learned was there were other uses for DocuSign, it didn't have to be just document signatures.

06_segment-04	So January of twenty twelve we had uh a new application that came out iPackager which was replacing test prep. In January of twenty-twelve although it came in at the end of the year, by the end of the year we got that auto clone feature. Without that auto clone feature what we had to do is, to build a package, a test package. So, I planned to automate the whole process. So, I asked them for two days, two weeks, and build my code in uh some test which is like sequence plus code and did a demo for the IT team who developed the iPackager application.	But there was a feature auto clone which was not incorporated in that release. There were more than two hundred fields that need to be filled with data and when I sat for the two-day training I figured that it's going to take forever for every person in the team to do it manually, enter two hundred fields to build one test package. But since it was all production involvement, people were not willing to take it, uh take my idea of uh  automating the whole process. So, I asked them for two days, two weeks, and build my code in uh some test which is like sequence plus code and did a demo for the IT team who developed the iPackager application.

When I showed them what it can do, how it can take all the data from test prep and put it in iPackager, which, uh uh manually a person may take more than two days to build one package, my code was taking thirty minutes to build the entire package. When I gave them the demo, they were one hundred percent convinced that this is the best approach to take. So the whole team agreed to use the uh script that I built for them and the entire year the whole, my code was used to built over six hundred packages by using the automation process.

	In January of twenty-twelve although it came in at the end of the year, by the end of the year we got that auto clone feature. So, I planned to automate the whole process. When I showed them what it can do, how it can take all the data from test prep and put it in iPackager, which, uh uh manually a person may take more than two days to build one package, my code was taking thirty minutes to build the entire package. When I gave them the demo, they were one hundred percent convinced that this is the best approach to take. So the whole team agreed to use the uh script that I built for them and the entire year the whole, my code was used to built over six hundred packages by using the automation process.
	But there was a feature auto clone which was not incorporated in that release. Without that auto clone feature what we had to do is, to build a package, a test package. So, I planned to automate the whole process. When I gave them the demo, they were one hundred percent convinced that this is the best approach to take. So the whole team agreed to use the uh script that I built for them and the entire year the whole, my code was used to built over six hundred packages by using the automation process.
	Uh The team IT team who developed it gave us a training for two days on how to use this new application and how to move on from test prep to iPackager. In January of twenty-twelve although it came in at the end of the year, by the end of the year we got that auto clone feature. But since it was all production involvement, people were not willing to take it, uh So, I asked them for two days, two weeks, and build my code in uh some test which is like sequence plus code and did a demo for the IT team who developed the iPackager application. When I gave them the demo, they were one hundred percent convinced that this is the best approach to take.	But there was a feature auto clone which was not incorporated in that release. In January of twenty-twelve although it came in at the end of the year, by the end of the year we got that auto clone feature. It's very time consuming, there can be human errors. When I gave them the demo, they were one hundred percent convinced that this is the best approach to take. So the whole team agreed to use the uh script that I built for them and the entire year the whole, my code was used to built over six hundred packages by using the automation process.
	So January of twenty twelve we had uh a new application that came out iPackager which was replacing test prep. In January of twenty-twelve although it came in at the end of the year, by the end of the year we got that auto clone feature. Without that auto clone feature what we had to do is, to build a package, a test package. So, I planned to automate the whole process. And since they were uhconvinced by my idea, my team had to take it because it was coming now from IT group as to take it.	Uh The team IT team who developed it gave us a training for two days on how to use this new application and how to move on from test prep to iPackager.

Suppose the fifth e-mail address is different we have to put number five there. and it just looks at uh a match, or if it sees an exact mark with the previous record it just puts like the numbering one, two, three, four and then the next fifth one is not a match it will put one there. So that was the code	I try to automate the processes, and I shouldn't be telling you but I do it click and I can walk away, take a break and come when the work is done , that's the kind of background I have.

We could tell the situation was like  she wanted to promote the person, she liked the person and she wanted to do it fine, that happens everywhere. So I approached my manager and I tried to explain to her about the situation.	Uh One of the situations I was in was I developed MS access application where the data needs to be input by the team members on a package is built. We could tell the situation was like  she wanted to promote the person, she liked the person and she wanted to do it fine, that happens everywhere. So, how about we give this task to everybody in the team, whoever is a lead of particular program. Like if he is TOEIC lead so he can do only for TOEIC because he would understand TOEIC better than TOEFL, GRE HiSET.	Uh One of the situations I was in was I developed MS access application where the data needs to be input by the team members on a package is built. And I see it around happening all the time, but then the other team members started coming to me and saying the data which is being put in is incorrect and we will look bad if this data goes out of our team, we are saying incorrect things here, what to do. So, how about we give this task to everybody in the team, whoever is a lead of particular program. So how about the lead should be allowed to do that, and it was a difficult communication I would say because I find it more difficult when I see that the manager is trying to do something and, we can see it's coming, but the approach is incorrect.

When you are in these project situations and these groups, you really need to focus on what that project is and the understanding of people's different life situations and come up with a clear cut plan of what exactly each person needs to put together and uh add into the project so that they can complete it as a group and uh make a successful project out of it.
	In a lot of my course work I did a writer at night. And often associated with these courses especially in the business and management courses I was taking, uh a large quantity of those had group projects associated with them. You really have to break yourself away from the personal issues of it.	In a lot of my course work I did a writer at night. You really have to break yourself away from the personal issues of it. You can never know why someone may not be agreeing with you, why someone may not be as committed, why maybe someone has some drastically different view point.	In a lot of my course work I did a writer at night. There was often times a lot of conflict, you had people that had various different work ethics, various different understanding of a subject matter, uh different levels of commitment to the project um and it created a lot of attention and I've had multiple situations where we had multiple team members who did not get along for that particular project. You really have to break yourself away from the personal issues of it.

That level of trust has built over a longer period of time, so that when we go and we communicate these things, you are going to leverage that trust that you build up to get people to negotiate with them to buy into the fact that these changes that we are making is either good for everyone or good for these people or good for these program. um So that might be sufficient enough trust.
	I've been a member of uh the test taker resolution services for about seven or eight years now, and over the course of that tenure, we've had a lot of different changes that have taken place that we've had to communicate to staff a variety of different levels.

Where this comes into the negotiation part, is that often times when changes occur, especially organization changes, shifting responsibilities or programs, it's very similar to a negotiation when you meet a variety of different staff about it.

	Because you are trying to negotiate with them to have them buy into this new idea and a key component of whether or not they're going to buy into this, is whether or not they trust you. For other items, uh smaller term negotiations it may just be as simple as uh you follow it up on the email that you said you were going to so that when you call your prospective client back and you start negotiating with them more, they trust that at least in the first instance you followed up and you said, you did what you said you were going to do. um So that might be sufficient enough trust.

	Because you are trying to negotiate with them to have them buy into this new idea and a key component of whether or not they're going to buy into this, is whether or not they trust you.

So I'm now in the situation where I have someone else to sell me a car, I have a car I want to buy. I kind of took a step back and said okay, what do I want out of this? What is the most important thing to me? Well and what's the most important thing for mumble across the way for me, right which is to make a profit not only his company but himself? So once I decided what I want in terms of the price and said this is what I feel comfortable paying, what can you do to make that happen?	uh About a year and a half ago, two years ago in two thousand twelve. I kind of took a step back and said okay, what do I want out of this? And I said okay I want the cheapest price possible.

So once I decided what I want in terms of the price and said this is what I feel comfortable paying, what can you do to make that happen? Regardless of any of the other factors I was okay with it and he got out of it what he needed which was he structured a deal that was going to make him look good or whatever his other goals are.

08_segment-06	And anytime that happens, a major component in the request for change involves processes designed and system architecture and making changes to certain things.

This is a topic I feel really comfortable talking about, uh in my tenure we've had a lot of different um issues or requests for changes.

If these tedious boring tasks involve a lot of subject matter and quality control, it might be because your manager, or your supervisors really value this work that you are doing and you are able to show this great results.

In a situation a few weeks ago, that agency staff really upset and as I was listening to him describe the situation and describe what was happening, I really started to realize that the root issue wasn't about the another staff's attitude or what was being said to them, it was really about how they felt that another agency staff at their level was taking a leadership role that they felt that shouldn't be taken. Which is very different than the message they were communicating. So really listening and analyzing and hearing out what people are saying to you.	Because often times the proceed problem even from the staff that may be bringing to you is very different than the actual problem at its core. Which is very different than the message they were communicating. So really listening and analyzing and hearing out what people are saying to you.	In test taker services we use a large amount of agency staff due to the peaks and valleys of our processes and cycles and the programs that we support. With this influx of new staff uhwe have to be very adapt to training staff, bring them on board, teaching them subject matter knowledge that they need to do, communicating with them and telling them exactly what the tasks are that we need to accomplish. That's how you can break down these communication problems, that's how you're going to really get to the root causes of some of these issues and potentially you can really spear head and head some things off that would otherwise go to bigger issues.

	With this influx of new staff uhwe have to be very adapt to training staff, bring them on board, teaching them subject matter knowledge that they need to do, communicating with them and telling them exactly what the tasks are that we need to accomplish. In a situation a few weeks ago, that agency staff really upset and as I was listening to him describe the situation and describe what was happening, I really started to realize that the root issue wasn't about the another staff's attitude or what was being said to them, it was really about how they felt that another agency staff at their level was taking a leadership role that they felt that shouldn't be taken. Which is very different than the message they were communicating.	Through that exchange, often times we have communication issues and minor communication problems and me personally as a manager in test taker services I often have to rely on my listening skills to really take a moment and hear the issues or the complaints that people are bringing to me. Because often times the proceed problem even from the staff that may be bringing to you is very different than the actual problem at its core. Which is very different than the message they were communicating.

I broke them down into different groups They did revisions, uh they added, subtracted, they put in uh things that they wanted to do uh or qualities and expectations that they thought would be important.	Uh This is where you would see in many cases there were a lot of personal teacher bias for certain students over other students.

I broke them down into different groups	Uh One of the most surprising times for me in schools came when we had to uh at the end of the year as a faculty get together and select award winners.

They did revisions, uh they added, subtracted, they put in uh things that they wanted to do uh or qualities and expectations that they thought would be important. Uh I'm very glad that I backed down and allowed them to do that because what would their buy in. This was something that we had established my first year at the school and for my time period there it had worked very well.
	Uh This is where you would see in many cases there were a lot of personal teacher bias for certain students over other students. So what we did was and I thought in reality this worked out very well was  that I took the list that I had drawn up. so we had four or five different groups working on this list. This was something that we had established my first year at the school and for my time period there it had worked very well.

09_segment-06	And um in this one presence in the school that I was in there were two of us who were working on college counseling. um And when I reviewed it and when I looked at it um I had encountered and I felt some strong differences of opinions.

	And we were working with uh different groups of students. um The other individual had been doing this for quite some time and had her own system to work with. What was the the expected result?

09_segment-07	um I moved back to the North East about uh four or five years ago. um Because I was beginning to feel very insecure in my abilities on what I was doing.

09_segment-08	And so um going as I say from a managerial role down to the employee role and working on just specific tasks. There were times I found it that I was just doing the same thing over and over and over and over. um But also had been given more on my plate than other colleagues.

09_segment-10	uh Coming to consensus on a uh decision is extremely difficult at times, um in particularly dealing with uh certain people. That it was best to um kind of take a little bit of a lead and just give each person the amount, quiet time, specific time so that we all could listen to each other, rather than talk over each other. I think that, uh my personal opinion is that some people have a very difficult time listening. um And so in this case uh after we were able to separate our selves, listen to what each one had to say, work together then discuss as a group.	um One of the best ways for us to overcome this idea of everyone not really communicating well, that people really weren't listening.

So uh taking statistics and putting them into graphs and pictures uh certainly made our committee understand more what it was about.
	Um and this is something that is extremely challenging because uh understanding test specs and test stats uh is not easy. What we have decided and my colleague and I when we looked at this and um our decision was the best way probably to present the material so that the test development committee would understand its relevance and its importance was to work through graphs and charts. uh what were some of the easier questions, what were some of the harder questions, what test type was more difficult than others. So uh taking statistics and putting them into graphs and pictures uh certainly made our committee understand more what it was about.
	That way then they were really able to see for example um what the mean score was, where did it fall on this graph? uh what were some of the easier questions, what were some of the harder questions, what test type was more difficult than others. So that when we start working on developing future exams and future items and future uh questions. So uh taking statistics and putting them into graphs and pictures uh certainly made our committee understand more what it was about.

10_segment-01	I was uh very nervous at that time because uh for me it's going out and you know just, I was a programmer, I'm a programmer so just sit at the desk and code is my job. so. So, I was a bit uh nervous to reaching out everyone and getting their help in the beginning but once, uh it also once you get them and once we put all the requirements together, uh other people in the other groups can also be able to um provide the questions and answers whenever I had questions or anything.	I was uh very nervous at that time because uh for me it's going out and you know just, I was a programmer, I'm a programmer so just sit at the desk and code is my job.

About a couple of years ago I had a situation where I had to uh take a lead charge of the project. um Even though I wasn't lead of the project due to my uh managers um busy schedule.

10_segment-03	Well, let's say pretty interesting question. So [one of the situation] um [we had two programmers], um right now in the project I'm the lead um developer. um They are very good programmers they are good people It's also a um thing that we take in a account but that's not the only um item that we look at. So I called the other programmer and he said, well I don't have anything but um I do feel that you are not being good to me or you didn't give me the important task and other person is taking over me and I felt that way.	So we have people that in the group we work as a group but um a couple of people we haven't. And then one day I got an email saying that, from the other programmers saying do you know why this programmer is behaving that way and all because I do not know. So I called the other programmer and he said, well I don't have anything but um I do feel that you are not being good to me or you didn't give me the important task and other person is taking over me and I felt that way. So, I tried to work it out saying that both of them are good and he um cannot be in a work situation, workplace that um without cooperating with one another in the project he won't be able to be successful. uh It has to be, they had to work together.
	[But], so this person felt very,um insecure and think that his work is not important the other person's work is. , I noticed that in a meeting.

	Well, let's say pretty interesting question. And that's it he stopped cooperating with other programmers, stopped talking to him and, um uh kind of giving him a cold shoulder [or], [it's] , I noticed that in a meeting. And then one day I got an email saying that, from the other programmers saying do you know why this programmer is behaving that way and all because I do not know. So I called the other programmer and he said, well I don't have anything but um I do feel that you are not being good to me or you didn't give me the important task and other person is taking over me and I felt that way.	um I mean, I'm sorry to say I have to admit it, it didn't happen just once, it happened more than once actually. , it's just um one of the programmers somehow felt that the uh other programmers work is more important than his and um he didn't say anything to me about that. um We just whenever we are assigned task we think you know, depending on the time on the, the programmers work in other projects we cancel all of that it's just not there everyday or what they cannot or can do. So I called the other programmer and he said, well I don't have anything but um I do feel that you are not being good to me or you didn't give me the important task and other person is taking over me and I felt that way. Not just by themselves but for the project's sake also.	um I mean, I'm sorry to say I have to admit it, it didn't happen just once, it happened more than once actually.

10_segment-04	Well uh last year we did a project to one of the programs here at ETS and that is already actually providing score reports. Uh she wasn't but somehow she felt like we are not capable of doing the project. And, once she did that and how the users responses, she actually was honest to me and said I can't be thankful enough to your manager, for providing me such a solution and so for, uh but she didn't apologize or anything.	And we, once we understand that and once I realized this is what's going on and she is kind of not being negative in the meetings um I tried to reach out to her by phone and e-mail and one time I spent, I got five minutes of time with her and I sat down with her and I said. And I remember she saying after our first demo uh [it has] how the score reports uh gets reported and uh how everything now can be automated and how users can be happy and I asked her to share the screens with the users. So, uh it was hard in the beginning but it kind of worked out I think this way, in this situation my director also helped me how to approach this person uh and get things done.

10_segment-06	Uh I tried it since we are actually with the current project we are working on we took a new technology initiative. And within that project we have another sub project and uh I kind of, I said that we need to take the sub project also needs to be in the new technology and stop [being], going back to the old one. I was like, well we are in the cold water already let's go deeper and uh  let's deal with it right now and stuff later. Uh I let listen everybody and what they have to say and make the decision.	Uh Earlier the situation, [this kind of], I didn't come across many of them but uh recently we were uh moving between two different technologies that we need to use in our upcoming project.

I think I don't do much persuasion or I don't be very pushy in our projects like uh when it comes uh and they ask for my uh opinions, I do lay it out but I really don't push it hard.	Uh Earlier the situation, [this kind of], I didn't come across many of them but uh recently we were uh moving between two different technologies that we need to use in our upcoming project. And within that project we have another sub project and uh I kind of, I said that we need to take the sub project also needs to be in the new technology and stop [being], going back to the old one. So uh so we decided to go with and they agreed, now my manager said I think that's, that's the way we should do it and right now we are already in deep water so let's just go with the new technology and if any huddles come uh we'll deal with it. So in this situation uh the rest of the group also kind of agreed to go with the new technology and uh we decided to go with the new service technology for this project.
	And within that project we have another sub project and uh I kind of, I said that we need to take the sub project also needs to be in the new technology and stop [being], going back to the old one. Because anyway we are in a new why not take everything in new in this uh project. Uh One of my teammate he's uh like no why can't we just use the old technology so that we don't have to uh hit too many huddles with the existing one and the upcoming one. Uh I let listen everybody and what they have to say and make the decision.
10_segment-07	So because ultimately it's the project's success, uh our failure depends on us, so yes it does make sense to get along with the person that we work with. We always work with this group there we have very good relationship with this group and uh they always accomplish, uh provide what we need. It's not the person is bad, it's just the person has a different uh personality. Uh it's working, it's going on uh I won't say the way I want to work with her in future projects, I would say no but at least we are in this now so we had to make it work.
	Well in many situations every time you work in a project of the group you don't have to, it's not necessary that you had to like every person that comes in the group and it's the same thing they don't have to like me or but I try my best you know to do work together with other person in the project. But in this group we had a new person, they had a new person and that person was assigned to one of the projects that I'm working with. It's not the person is bad, it's just the person has a different uh personality. That's how, that's why we feel like it.	Uh so I do have a couple situations that I had been like this, uh recently we started work. We always work with this group there we have very good relationship with this group and uh they always accomplish, uh provide what we need. She would be more visible in the e-mails and everything but when it comes to the work it's, it's not uh productive. Uh there was a big tension going on and it was continuing that way, so uh I suggested that she wants to go out for lunch or anything she agreed.

	Uh so I do have a couple situations that I had been like this, uh recently we started work. We always work with this group there we have very good relationship with this group and uh they always accomplish, uh provide what we need.

Uh there was a big tension going on and it was continuing that way, so uh I suggested that she wants to go out for lunch or anything she agreed. so I invited another friend and we had some friendly conversation at lunch and	So because ultimately it's the project's success, uh our failure depends on us, so yes it does make sense to get along with the person that we work with. Uh so I do have a couple situations that I had been like this, uh recently we started work. And we always say, well they provide assistance for our projects so.

Uh so I do have a couple situations that I had been like this, uh recently we started work. It's not the person is bad, it's just the person has a different uh personality. uh I understand things were very good but it's okay I tried to keep everything in the e-mail and uh tried to specific relating to work you know this is what we need and uh whether she can focus on this and provide this for us.	Well in many situations every time you work in a project of the group you don't have to, it's not necessary that you had to like every person that comes in the group and it's the same thing they don't have to like me or but I try my best you know to do work together with other person in the project.

At the same time I was nervous to go out to lunch myself with her Uh it's working, it's going on uh I won't say the way I want to work with her in future projects, I would say no but at least we are in this now so we had to make it work.

10_segment-08	Uh I do when we all have our own different projects Uh But uh tedious [I don't think my], I can't, I can say sometimes it can get tedious but I don't mind if it's the tedious, relating to coding I won't mind doing it at all. That way but uh I think it's going okay for now.	Whether do I  feel like uh that I'm doing more than the other teammates? I don't know I mean well uh we have two other leads and we are three leads in our group right now. I wouldn't say it's too boring or uh tedious.
	Well, my job is not anything of physical demand, physically demanding it's just uh spending more time on a task mostly uh it's the one thing. They want to reach to a point that everybody agrees upon.

11_segment-01	I think that one of the, most current examples that I could use for this is when I was working on the TExES Theater exam as the lead admin. I was charged with procurements, which meant that I had to identify and recruit potential outside item writers for the TExES theater exam. I was able to conceptualize, what needed to be done and then implement it which I think shows admirable leadership skills.
	When I started I looked at the search parameters that had come up during discussion and I found a website that specialized in uh TExES educator theater awards.

Which is more than the free housing an opportunity to serve as a resource to the students, be there at their time of need, of course we anticipated that this would be late night talks, or just making sure that people don't get locked up in their rooms. Or letting them know that if they needed help getting in contact after the storm was over, there are various resources on campus to help them do so.
	So in terms of building motivation the first thing that comes to my mind is when myself and a number of my fellow staff members were actually transported to the bush uh campus center where we slept on the floor for a number of days with a number of our residents. And it was particularly frustrating for some of my staff members and myself since we lived close by, but due to our work we weren't allowed to go home because we have to be there to serve as a resource for the students.

Zack and Cody were very passionate about the club but had very different ideas with the direction in which it should go and this difference caused them to clash multiple times.

11_segment-05	It was a win win situation and I'm glad to say that that co-worker is now one of my close friends.
	So what I did is I found a co-worker at one of my previous jobs, who is excellent at Excel and I bargained with her that I would do all of her calendering for her department because she got very frustrated with Outlook, if she would just spend half an hour each week teaching me Excel.	But I wasn't always that way, there was a time when I was very new to Excel and I needed a lot of training, but I had a lot of previous experience with Outlook.	So that was one of the ways that I taught myself about Excel through that job experience with that relationship with a co-worker and I was able to sharpen up my Outlook skills because when you're teaching someone, you then become more proficient in what you're demonstrating to them.	It was a win win situation and I'm glad to say that that co-worker is now one of my close friends.

11_segment-07	At a former job I was tasked with being in charge of this project and I was put on this project with a team of people including a co-worker who had a very different work style than I did and he and I had previously had uh discussions about these differences. I like to let people work the way that they work best, I feel as if one of the biggest hampers to productivity is to micro manage.	I also believe in learning from differences that people have because, as my parents like to remind me, there is more than one way to skin a cat and somebody always knows something that you don't know. It's not about how it gets done it's the fact that it gets done and done well.
	I also believe in learning from differences that people have because, as my parents like to remind me, there is more than one way to skin a cat and somebody always knows something that you don't know.

	As the team leader I took responsibility of talking to him outside of the meeting, outside of any, our work with our other co-workers in addressing the fact that I would allow him to work the way that he thought was the most productive, if he would be more open to constructive criticism in terms of the end results. It's not about how it gets done it's the fact that it gets done and done well.
	And he ended up converting me into his way of doing things, because that result was just fantastic. And so I learned that open communication and trust is really what's necessary when you're working with someone that you do not necessarily get along with or you have a difference of opinion on in terms of how to get things done.

So at the end of the project I was very pleased with his approach, I was very pleased with the way that we had worked all together, he I guess was very happy that I had spoken to him [that's why], because he kept me in the loop the entire time, every week I would get a status update as to where he was with the project. And he ended up converting me into his way of doing things, because that result was just fantastic.

What I learned from that is that it is important to voice your opinion, but you have to remember that when you are not in a leadership position and when someone else is you have to respect their authority and not try and undermine them in any way.	And so in the interest of not causing disharmony within the group, I didn't bring up my objections at a group level, but I instead went to talk to him separately outside of the group.

	A few years ago I had an issue with a co-worker who I felt was Just not really listening to any of the directives that I gave her or who, there was just something wrong with the way that we were communicating with each other, where I didn't sufficiently understood and I later learned that she just felt as if she wasn't being heard. And what that involved is when she told me something instead of having a response right away, you know sort of being quiet and really taking my time to visibly absorb the information because when someone tells you something and you have a response right away it can give the impression that you may not have thought through what they said and sometimes that just five second lag where they can see visibly the process, it  can mean a world of difference in terms of how they feel that you've resolved that information or received that information.	So while she was talking to me and explaining what her frustrations with the project were, I would say things like I see what you're saying or I agree with you, I would also mirror her posture a little bit and if I felt she was getting exasperated I would let that show in my face like yes this is really a big problem.

And that was the news that I have to communicate to my manager as soon as she got back from vacation and so the way that I did it is, as soon as she came in, I let her settle in, we made small talk about how the vacation was and then at the top of my priority list in terms of letting her know events that occurred while she was gone, that was the first thing that I addressed.

And one of my speeches is actually highly technical in terms of explaining different Excel formulas and use of conditional formatting for better data recording.	As I previously mentioned and my resume reflects one of my areas of specialty is with Excel and I find Excel really intuitive, I absolutely adore working with that program but not everyone does. Since that speech I've had numerous phone calls and emails requesting either help or thanking me for helping them understand the program just a little bit more and exposing them to what as now become highly useful and quick to learn skills in terms of data clean up and organization.

12_segment-01	So several months ago, I knew that for this one major project that I have been assigned to, we had to do a series of cog-webs leading up to a major client meeting that we had in May. So it got to the point where we were informed that we had these upcoming duties probably back around January and between January and May we had to do two series of cog-webs and then analyze all the data. So when I was in that situation, I pretty much took it upon myself, I was rather assertive in terms of preparing all the materials the IRB, all of the regulatory documents.	And so we did the first series and then finished up all that work. But then we had the second series to which we had maybe a month before the major client meeting to complete the second series of cog-webs. So in that situation, I definitely assumed a leadership role even though I technically was not a formal leader and because of that we had a positive outcome.

12_segment-02	So a colleague and I received notice that North Eastern Educational Research Association released its call for proposals and that we were able if we had any content that we were willing to work on and that we would be able to submit our proposals. In order to be a part of that conference and in order to speak at that conference.	So I actually oriented him to a different project sent over some data to him ripped on the background of that project and helped guide him into reading a proposal, to which he definitely went ahead, accepted the challenge and he seemed really motivated to submit a final product to nearer our baseline content that he never had any exposure to. So I think that definitely gave him some motivation to work on an extra project that otherwise he will not be in a position to execute.
	But because this project has a lot of NDA requirements he was not in a position where he was able to cement a proposal based on that project. So I think that definitely gave him some motivation to work on an extra project that otherwise he will not be in a position to execute.
	So this one colleague of mine, he and I do a lot of work as lateral colleagues on the same major federal project. Luckily he was able to pull it off and he will be presenting at this upcoming conference.	And I know one day he talked to me really upset or at least he looked really upset saying, oh well I won't be able to attend here because I don't have any information I can work with, that I can develop a proposal out of.

12_segment-04	So my previous job this was a big part of my previous position. I was an allied therapist at a psychiatric hospital. So in order to help them recover, we had to try to develop a trusting rapport with them and in addition to that we also tried negotiating with them.

So in order to help them recover, we had to try to develop a trusting rapport with them and in addition to that we also tried negotiating with them. But also in terms of negotiating, I would always try be really transparent with them and sometimes they would make requests beyond me to which I would communicate assertively.

But [I would definitely] in those situations, I would never promise something that I would not be able to keep but I would let them know that I'll try, I'll advocate for them and that I'll do what I can whatever is possible.

One big part of that, of course in order to gain trust of my former clients, I would always treat them in a very respectful manner, and I would frequently try to go out of my way be very friendly to them.

	So in the past when I had to communicate difficult or critical feedback to my supervisor, I would go about it a couple of different ways, it really depended on the situation to be honest.

And sometimes one method that I use a lot is if I have something extremely complicated that I need to communicate, or if there is a couple of points that I need to share with her, I'll write it down in an organized manner so that I don't forget anything, and so that I can cover every topic and every relevant point in a logical manner.

So if you wanted to stay later you would just throw your name into a hat and if they picked your name then, then you had to go home. So it was at the end solved in a very fair way.

15_segment-05	So at the lab that I worked at, it was a food science lab. And in return I would end up washing more of the lab equipment, so we would have like you know pipettes and uh different lab equipment that needed to be washed at the end of the day.	And uh one of the jobs was after we finished growing the bacteria on a petri dish, you had to count the number of spore colonies on it. And in return I would end up washing more of the lab equipment, so we would have like you know pipettes and uh different lab equipment that needed to be washed at the end of the day.	And in return I would end up washing more of the lab equipment, so we would have like you know pipettes and uh different lab equipment that needed to be washed at the end of the day. So I would just count less of the bacteria and just wash more of the equipment.
	So I compromised with a fellow worker by asking him to do more of my plates than just his. So I would just count less of the bacteria and just wash more of the equipment.
	So at the lab that I worked at, it was a food science lab. So basically we had to grow bacteria on different samples of food based petri dishes.

So this was extremely frustrating work for me because I just don't want to sit there and count hundreds of different bacteria colonies because it's extremely frustrating and if you lose count you have to start all over again.

15_segment-06	And it was cooked twice basically and was left sitting at the salad bar because nobody had finished the previous bread and chicken where it came from. So I essentially convinced everyone else that this chicken was the best bet because everybody else was essentially just hot food.	And so usually the grad students would start running out of ideas and they would start asking the rest of us, Oh, you know, what do you think will be the most contaminated at the end of the day? They just spread it, it was a sliced up bread and chicken and so I proposed to the rest of the team that this had potential to become the most dirty because it was a viable source of protein, oils, and fats.	So at the food science lab occasionally we had to go out to the nearby downing holes to pick more samples of food because we were studying which foods at the dining hall were basically the dirtiest or had the potential to become the most dirty. And so usually the grad students would start running out of ideas and they would start asking the rest of us, Oh, you know, what do you think will be the most contaminated at the end of the day?	And so usually the grad students would start running out of ideas and they would start asking the rest of us, Oh, you know, what do you think will be the most contaminated at the end of the day?

And so usually the grad students would start running out of ideas and they would start asking the rest of us, Oh, you know, what do you think will be the most contaminated at the end of the day? So we just went with the different picks of the salad bar to try to find out what was the best choice.

15_segment-07	So basically we had to keep the same cubicles at all times, like we weren't allowed to switch cubicles really. So we would only really see her around lunch time and uh she would, she wouldn't exactly come to our group to try to hang out with us. oh how are you?	and she actually kind of wreathed when you were near her. So basically we didn't get any of the positive interactions like you know How is it going or whatever.	So at the call center, Anna, the girl that I previously mentioned, uh none of our friends really liked her or anything.

15_segment-08	So basically if I was sitting at the top of the queue to receive the next call then I press that button twice instead of just once then I would be sent all the way back to the bottom of the queue and everyone else would have to answer the calls before me and that would give me sufficient time to fill out the rest of the paperwork that I had to do.	[And then], but I would press it twice and that would send me to the bottom of the call queue.	And so what I did was just try to go through them as quick as possible, but I knew that there was going to be a never ending stream of calls for the entire day so what I did was actually press the busy button twice in a row after I finished a call, because the first time you press it you're supposed to fill out all the necessary paperwork that went with the call.

But now that I think about it, even though I kept getting sent to the bottom of the queue, the fact that I still handled more than like double of some people's calls, it's still probably pretty ridiculous.

15_segment-09	So it really started off as kind of group project amongst the grad students in a normal sense but anything that they thought wasn't going to be good in it was removed, and we would have almost nothing to say about it.
	And there is honestly not much we could have done about the situation because their scope of knowledge was infinitely greater than ours and not only that it was pretty much their project and that were just going to be helpers and subordinates to it.	So at the fruit science lab there were, uh basically sometimes we would have group projects to finish and occasionally the grad students were asking us for different suggestions and inputs.

15_segment-10	So often times we would just have to sit there and listen to them yell at us continually for having to not done it. and basically we overcome this problem by saying on every single exam that they were given for the AP test they had an opportunity to fill it out and say I want these scores sent out to so and so college. It was an error because the student failed to fill it out.	So often times we would just have to sit there and listen to them yell at us continually for having to not done it. It was an error because the student failed to fill it out. And we can see it through all the computer paperwork that we were given that they actually just failed to send it out.	So at the call center, essentially the whole job was using listening skills to overcome communication problems. It was an error because the student failed to fill it out. And usually after we finish telling this to the parents they would immediately stop being angry.	So majority of our calls were related to a student who did fail to fill out the proper paperwork while taking the exam, just send the scores, his or her sure, scores to the college of their choice.

15_segment-11	And so obviously this refund is impossible because they filled out all the work to send it to that college so why on earth would anybody refund that? So basically this lady calls and she's like I demand like my ten dollar refund for this, and I was like I'm sorry, like that's impossible. And so I was like all right, well I'm sorry. I'll see if I can get him on the line. And so he's like uh you know, like nothing you could do about it. After two hours of trying to get a ten dollar refund this lady was finally like, Okay I guess you tried  your best.	And so one particular lady comes to mind, this lady called about um a one year refund for having sent out a score to a college that they don't feel that they should have sent it out to. You can't get this refund because you filled out all the necessary paperwork for it and you had it sent it out. my manager is that they are not going to get the manager because your call is ridiculous and there's just nothing that the manager can do anyways regarding it.

15_segment-12	So basically we were like, okay press the power button, turn on the computer, put in the logging information to access the computer.

So obviously there was a lot of unhappiness with everyone on the community you had people who were vice presidents and CEOs have companies that were dedicating their time and uh possibly even resources and money to participate in events.

And took it as a good learning experience and not a negative way uh from the situation and have build up on that and it definitely makes me think twice before I say something during a group project and criticize someone else when I myself may not have the correct solution to the problem.
	And one area where we constantly struggled with was obtaining media coverage for the event.

	I can only speak from personal experience that it may have been myself that was one of the more difficult people to work with and again I go back to learning experiences when I was young and just starting out my professional career while working uh for the American Diabetes Association which we relied very heavily on the community to be members of a community, to help with fund-raising efforts, getting the message out to the community.

So to come into a company that was very closely knit as a family to begin with and as an outsider and presumably much younger than everyone else was very difficult. However it is always good to try new things so rather than radically change a program at a time I would maybe change one or two aspects to the program and see how well they were received.	So it was taking the time to get to know individuals and listening to how they had done things in the past and realizing that if an organization had been in business for eighty or ninety years that maybe they did know something about what they were doing. Actually provide them with the disks they were able to take that information back to their companies and share it with their employees. Thinking that this was a way that you would be able to share the information and even gain greater participation at a future event.

	Anyone who has worked with committees or volunteers knows that it can be a very difficult thing to do time after time and even when they can be what we call paid volunteers such as with a chief aids that we hire for AP readings every year. And so year after year she would just get beat down with people who wouldn't listen, wouldn't work with her and did not want to come back. However with her she had this wealth of knowledge that was very hard to share with other people who had never had this responsibility before. And from that we were able to build training materials that she would share out with her reading assistance to make it easier and we were then actually able to implement to multiple subjects at the same reading sites as well.

However with her she had this wealth of knowledge that was very hard to share with other people who had never had this responsibility before. Practically begging her to stay on and help with us and teach us what you know and ask us what can we do to help you in return. So definitely begging and helping out can work at times and other times it cannot.

However with her she had this wealth of knowledge that was very hard to share with other people who had never had this responsibility before. So one of the things I sat down and I did with her is I listened to what her chief complains were and I said okay, if we can make these changes and if we can make things easier for you will you stay on another year.

	And there was one in particular about a new initiative that was happening in Europe. But the outcome was beneficial, in that we were able to make contacts with other people and get some great papers on the topic, because even though the program of Reach was happening in Europe there was a lot of US based manufacturers that would do business with European countries in which their materials would have to be in alignment with the rules and regulations as they apply to Europe.

	So at a young age I learnt very quickly how to work with people who you may not like at a particular time and as I've encountered this in my professional career.

So I'd say okay, you saw the students, saw your child would write an essay and then the school would send back that essay what my complain does is we gather all the essays together and we send them to our conventions center where we have people come and sit for seven days and score them. but, uh when they start to lose interest I think they would but they get the general idea of what it is that I'm talking about.
	Could be a Chief Reader, could be a Change request or could be a constructed response. So, really is almost like talking uh in a foreign tongue to a lot of my family members. So again that all goes back to taking what could be a very complex thing So for example for, all the work that I do on AP I would usually start with saying so did any of your children or do you know anyone who maybe took an AP exam when they were in high school. So I'd say okay, you saw the students, saw your child would write an essay and then the school would send back that essay what my complain does is we gather all the essays together and we send them to our conventions center where we have people come and sit for seven days and score them.

It became very clear from the beginning that although we all agreed what needed to be done, there were two members who didn't get who didn't um agree with how we should do it or who should take the lead on doing different things and so every meeting um just would deteriorate into one person saying what he thought should be done and the other person saying what she thought should be done. so that we could, they could have, everyone could see that the were in agreement when they actually thought that they were in disagreement.

Uh There are many times I have females as well.	Reality was that never happened uh so there were times that I felt it was important that another case manager be with me in particular when I was transporting a male from the prison system back into the community and that actually uh believe it or not required some finagling and getting my male uh counterparts to stop what they were doing on their case loads, which were actually pretty heavy, and come on to this uh transfer with me in getting a male, uh it was really a client back into a community. They are more comfortable with having the female with them so that situations uh don't occur uh that could be mentally harmful to the case manager's career.	Uh There are many times I have females as well. And that's basically it, that really involved uh making that special effort to really appreciate the help.
	Uh There was a policy set in place by the community mental health center that I worked for that stated that there should always be two case managers out in the community on a case all the time. So uh within the group itself you have to develop relationships with each of the case workers and make sure that uh you help them out on errand situations.

This situation here that I'm going to touch on has to do uh with the electronic Inine uh creation here at ETS. uh [In writing the electronic Inine], well let me back up first of all I have to say, I'm really not that technical so for one to think that I'm going to take something technical and explain it um is not really ever going to be the case in the sense here that I did understand certain uh aspects of writing an electronic Inine. I certainly was not um the electronic uh guru here in writing that, that part was left to DocuSign who actually did the uh code writing.

	I discover I have an issue with the Inine. uh I went to DocuSign, worked with them.

	uh Electronically I wanted to protect it, there were some information that the authorizer presented. It was seen that I didn't want them to see. I went and explained that to my director that I'm going to have to revise this uh and she agreed. I had to do, is just explain what the issue was, and I did. And that actually worked  fairly well.

And the group head came and asked me if I would be willing to be the Supervisor for my data analyst. Now at that time we had a performance appraisal system that was based on allocating points and there were certain number of points that could be allocated and they were a total maximum number of points for the entire stat analysis units that you couldn't exceed. Uh but if somebody tries to uh make me put in negative comments to justify giving her a lower rating, I won't do that.	What happened was my data analyst was having trouble getting along with her supervisor.

There is nothing to negotiate we are trying to do the best job we can. And uh the Test Developer had given him his best estimates.

The lawyer ETS's General Council agreed with us and the Test Developers uh gave some arguments which made no sense to me and still doesn't.

I'm sure there had been times when I did have to use my listening skills to overcome a communication problem at work. But I'm having trouble thinking of a single specific case when I had to do that. Then you have to listen to what they're saying so that you can see what it is that they don't understand. Uh 

 And that happens very often when people ask you technical questions. Sometimes their perception of the problem isn't what the problem really is and so you have to ask probing questions to find out what it is they're trying to accomplish.	Then you have to listen to what they're saying so that you can see what it is that they don't understand. And I do this all the time when I'm consulting with people who come to me with statistical questions. [Because sometimes what they think they're asking isn't what they really, isn't] They'll ask you a question, and sometimes the question isn't exactly what they need to know.

	But I'm having trouble thinking of a single specific case when I had to do that. I know that I'm often asked to translate uh technical uh concepts into language that non-technical people can understand.

There were a number of steps that which we could have avoided but didn't, I could think of three ways that we could have avoided the problem but we didn't. And I had to explain how I discovered the problem, how I established that there was a problem.	And first of all how I discovered that we have this problem, because we didn't realize originally that the scores, that there was any problems with the scores. But when I investigated, I questioned about it and discovered much to my shock that we had, that's when I discovered that we had recorded a lot of wrong scores. There were a number of steps that which we could have avoided but didn't, I could think of three ways that we could have avoided the problem but we didn't. And in this decision when I think all the way up to the President of the ETS, who decided that we would rectify the situation by sparing no expense and redoing all the scores and getting it right to the extent that it was possible.	And then I had to explain how it had happened, and uh it was a rather complicated technical explanation step by step. And I had to explain um how the problem occurred, what we had done that had caused the problem to occur and what we could do to rectify the situation. And the outcome was that we corrected all the incorrect scores but we still got sued and wound up paying millions. Literally millions of dollars in damages.

25_segment-12	And I study a great deal of time, uh first of all deciding what it is that the people I'm going to be talk to need to know about this particular subject. There will be a large amount overlap but it won't be exactly the same. and then I have to figure out ways to explain it uh so that they can understand it easily. One thing I've found is that you don't throw formulas at people because uh I know I can't learn way and I don't think many people can. Uh I use words, short simple phrases wherever possible, use a lot of pictures when I can explain something with a diagram and the simpler the diagram the better in general. But I have to remind myself constantly not to try to put too much information on a slide, uh three or four phrases on a slide is about it.	Well it's difficult to pick a single time because I do this all the time, it's one of the major parts of my job. I give classes of item analysis, uh equating, I do a class called 'scores and score scales,' I give a class on reliability and validity. There will be a large amount overlap but it won't be exactly the same.

	Well recently uh a colleague and I were asked to come up with a PowerPoint presentation uh for a Praxis meeting. Eliminating the waiting time and then showing how this saves you time and money, she didn't want to do. Uh This led to her saying, Okay and just giving me just a bunch of notes to work with.	The subject was how best to use small groups of scores to work more effectively uh on prompts by splitting them up into teams. Uh This led to her saying, Okay and just giving me just a bunch of notes to work with. And I did a little interviewing as well, put it into a PowerPoint presentation, it had sixteen iterations, she liked it and she actually was the one who, she liked it so much it was so much comfortable	Uh This led to her saying, Okay and just giving me just a bunch of notes to work with.

Uh there's a couple of us that sat on the front line, so we were all responsible and charged with the task of uh manually entering the new hire information.	Uh During that time we also went through a phase where there was a new program um a revamped new hire program where the new hire actually inputed their own information. And we had a couple of meetings, I actually led a couple of meetings to get people's take or feel why they would be making errors versus why the new hires would be making an error. It turned out that we significantly reduced the amount of errors uh and so at this point right now all I have to do is the final part of my uh Six Sigma projects go ahead and be certified, but that the problem was resolved successfully.
	So that means that the errors could be have been spread amongst all of us, uh but because they wanted zero errors I underwent the task of uh making some suggestions.

Uh That's a pretty good question when you're in a situation where you are a part of a team and you have two members that don't work well together and honestly it happened very frequently especially um in certain areas here in ETS.

A work situation where I was not the formal leader uh is with the quality team that I work with here in the Quality Excellence Department of the Office of Quality. Uh There are probably six quality engineers uh one of which is a Senior Quality Engineer and two of which are Quality Managers.	The background is that we were all tasked about reading a book uh about strength binders and then we had to take uh some kind of quiz and it resulted in analysis about what our strengths were on strategy, on uh a couple of different, four different dimensions. The outcome was a success, I was able to uh not only guide the conversation but as well do the PowerPoint slide and then revise it as needed to make sure it was coherent once all of the other quality engineers gave their input.
	And the task uh from our executive director was to put together a presentation. Uh And ensure that our work product uh [was one], it met the objectives uh that in terms of the PowerPoint presentation, that it was, you know quality and something that we could present to both the Vice President and to the team.

But for design for control a lot of times we're looking at programs that area already sort of operational and trying to ensure that we can ensure accuracy and timeliness of completion of sworn, right? uh So um one of the leaders of the group sort of sets the stage for how, you know for the task for me as a quality engineer in terms of following up on action items and controls and so on and so forth. But I did, what I did was I communicated what my concerns were um and I suggested that we have a meeting, um that meeting has not been scheduled um and what I did do was was then I escalated it to uh my manager who has oversight of the activity.	So there's an ongoing sort of program uh where considered design, design for control activities.

Especially at my job over the summer where I was an intern in a research company we had to order binders on binders in order to put studies to go out to the coordinators of studies in other states.

The binders had to be the correct size, and the people ordering them sometimes ordered the wrong size because they were not listening, and that was a communication's problem.

35_segment-01	So basically in every group project I've ever done I've tried to be the leader. but I always insist on just kind of giving people things to do. And it usually works out well because I typically have a good direction.

  I can't think of an incidence where it didn't work out well other than the times that somebody else tried to do what I was doing and take an informal leadership role. So in all in all it never really works out badly when I try to assume the leadership role, or once anyway.
	Okay, well a work situation in which I wasn't the formal leader but tried to take on leadership role. um Whether that is or is not true, I consider what they say, what they want to do. And usually even though I don't have a formal leadership position, they will do it. I can't think of an incidence where it didn't work out well other than the times that somebody else tried to do what I was doing and take an informal leadership role.	um Well my current job basically is being a student so this would apply to basically every group project ever.

 	Okay, well a work situation in which I wasn't the formal leader but tried to take on leadership role. I love being in charge of things and I love just kind of having the reigns on situations.

Well my current job basically is being a student so this would apply to basically every group project ever. but I always insist on just kind of giving people things to do.

And then I'll try, since I'm not a formal leader I'll try to nudge them into doing what I want them to do. Sometimes if that doesn't work I'll explicitly say you should do this. During these situations we tend to butt heads a bit more but it's still very productive and [we still], [I'm very good at] [if somebody else] if somebody else tries to take leadership I'm very good at just kind of relinquishing the power and I can kind of be like the beta to their alpha, whatever it is in wolf packs, I don't know.

35_segment-02	And if I do have subordinates it's just in my mind nobody else is real well So back on a situation, I'll give you one from like last week. So we're working together, we're doing this, then all of a sudden we kind of just lost our steam. We stopped doing it as well and then we got distracted So me and my other friend we both like to take kind of a leadership role.

   We were like Okay, if we study for one more hour we can go get Froyo. So they are like all very into, they're like Okay let's do this.

So in any situation I feel like kind of offering incentives for people to do their best or to do well or to try really is the best way to go about it because I don't think it's possible for there to be a bad outcome if you're offering people something they want in exchange for something that they are fully within their power to do.

  We changed around a lot of what had already been done but we left in some of what she had wanted to be fair because we couldn't cut her out completely like she did to us. Sometimes you just have to be very firm in what you want and how you think you need to act in order just to get it.	I can't really remember the context of this situation but I do know that I've been in a group, working on a group project before where someone's all consuming leadership has been an issue. And she was like, What do you mean? And I just said to her, I was like You are being completely unfair. just generally things of that nature. 

  There was no more all consuming leadership role, it was just us pitching our opinions. We changed around a lot of what had already been done but we left in some of what she had wanted to be fair because we couldn't cut her out completely like she did to us.	And she wasn't listening because I had some pretty great ideas to be completely honest. And she was like, What do you mean? just generally things of that nature. 

  Eventually she was kind of offended by it I'll be honest but it was for the good of the group because after I kind of chastised her and yelled at her a little she stepped down and it became more of a group effort after that. There was no more all consuming leadership role, it was just us pitching our opinions. We changed around a lot of what had already been done but we left in some of what she had wanted to be fair because we couldn't cut her out completely like she did to us.

I was uh given the responsibility to uh uh figure out what the issue was or what the root cause was. Uh during uh the root cause analysis uh it was very obvious to me that it was not the database that had the issue uh which was the root cause. And uh I think the outcome was pretty good, I was given the presidential award for it uh and uh that report still runs and it's uh sent out to upper management on a regular basis which has been automated at this point. And we have avoided many disasters because of that.
	Uh one of the most challenging um issues that uh I faced in the last year was when uh the two TOEFL iBT had uh uh an outage.

So uh the opportunity definitely arose when I learned to, um you know inquire about their interest or needs and then also cater uh my initiatives and ideas to their needs.	So with that I don't necessarily know how to do that but I know that there are um several of my, uh you know my classmates and other leaders of the community who know how to do these types of things. So with that being said I had to uh meet with them and also uh allow them to give me uhtheir rubric, their skills, um the things that have worked for their organizations. Um And simply asking what their uh best advice is, how to go about it and then proposing mine uh in addition to considering what they said. So all of which are behind this initiative and club uh which is absolutely outstanding.

	When I was learning continuous improvement I had mentors who were specialists in groups dynamics and that type of thing.

  Uh so if you want to expose situations or ideas, charts and graphs are very effective in helping to make this happen. Uh I've had a variety of uh results from overwhelming successes where people just caught onto it immediately and carried out on the uh proposal. Uh And then hopefully you stay focused, you stay disciplined, you remember the long-term objectives and keep pursuing that.
	Charts and graphs do a tremendous job of transmitting a lot of the information in a very short period of time. Uh so if you want to expose situations or ideas, charts and graphs are very effective in helping to make this happen. And I've had situations where uh we've proposed this grand scheme and activity and uh as it turns out we've had to take it piecemeal, a little bit at a time get a concession of willingness to try something going forward. Uh And then hopefully you stay focused, you stay disciplined, you remember the long-term objectives and keep pursuing that.
	Uh We try and outline simply what would be involved in the proposal. Uh We would try and explain the long-term benefits of this activity, we would try and identify some of the needs for why we move forward on this. Uh so if you want to expose situations or ideas, charts and graphs are very effective in helping to make this happen. Uh And then hopefully you stay focused, you stay disciplined, you remember the long-term objectives and keep pursuing that.

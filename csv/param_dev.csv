"10_segment-01","About a couple of years ago I had a situation where I had to uh take a lead charge of the project. um Even though I wasn't lead of the","project due to my uh managers um busy schedule. So he told me um Zurisha you have to take this task and uh um talk to the other people, other","groups in the, within the IT and get it, get work done. I was uh very nervous at that time because uh for me it's going out and you know","just, I was a programmer, I'm a programmer so just sit at the desk and code is my job. And talking to the other groups was um not kind of my","thing so. Anyway, uh I set up uh meetings with other groups and I introduced myself and I told them that I will be leading from our group.","And uh um I'll be taking uh any help from them until we accomplish the tasks that needs to be done for the projects. So, I was a bit uh","nervous to reaching out everyone and getting their help in the beginning but once, uh it also once you get them and once we put all the","requirements together, uh other people in the other groups can also be able to um provide the questions and answers whenever I had questions","or anything. So, I'm able to carry the task of course it was a bit rough in the beginning some people were not that cooperative. But once","they started realizing how important this is, um they are able to be cooperating and uh I was able to finish the task with uh no issues and",10,4.7,"5"
"10_segment-02","Well, uh we have a co-worker um that uh feels like, that uh person has to do only when she's told to what to do but not uh motivated herself. uh But uh","as been uh an uh IT programmer it's not like, you cannot just say I only do what I've been told to do. It's, you have to, you have to take ownership of","the work that you are given it's not like, uh just as a uh manager and a programmer relation. It's not just that you have to make sure that you are","being, take the ownership of all the task that you have to do if you are not able to, if you even know there is something that's not provided or","accurate, uh not accurate for your task. You have to reach out to the group or the people that needs to be uh able to help you out or need to provide","answers for that. um I tried a couple of times that uh if that person works in a way that I'm trying to help. Reaching out to people you know, if she has","issues that would actually give her in a good, put her in a good place in the work situation and stuff. Just being herself and not being, not taking any","kind of ownership. um Actually I wasn't that much of successful in that, it's just I, uh she feels like that we are trying to put her down but that's not","true. We are trying to uh help her, at least I tried my best to help her to uh come up the right way. um To help her it's not just the task or the job at","that time, it would help her career also. I tried to put it that way and uh that's how I try to motivate her. I don't know how much it helped her but",10,4.5,"4"
"10_segment-03","Well, let's say pretty interesting question. um Yes I do have that situation. um I mean, I'm sorry to say I have to admit it, it didn't happen just once, it happened more than once","actually. So [one of the situation] um [we had two programmers], um right now in the project I'm the lead um developer. So we have people that in the group we work as a group but um a","couple of people we haven't. um They are very good programmers they are good people, it's just um one of the programmers somehow felt that the uh other programmers work is more important","than his and um he didn't say anything to me about that. um We just whenever we are assigned task we think you know, depending on the time on the, the programmers work in other projects we","cancel all of that it's just not there everyday or what they cannot or can do. It's also a um thing that we take in a account but that's not the only um item that we look at. [But], so this","person felt very,um insecure and think that his work is not important the other person's work is. And that's it he stopped cooperating with other programmers, stopped talking to him and, um","uh kind of giving him a cold shoulder [or], [it's], I noticed that in a meeting. And then one day I got an email saying that, from the other programmers saying do you know why this","programmer is behaving that way and all because I do not know. So I called the other programmer and he said, well I don't have anything but um I do feel that you are not being good to me or","you didn't give me the important task and other person is taking over me and I felt that way. So, I tried to work it out saying that both of them are good and he um cannot be in a work","situation, workplace that um without cooperating with one another in the project he won't be able to be successful. Not just by themselves but for the project's sake also. uh It has to be,",10,4.1,"4"
"10_segment-04","Well uh last year we did a project to one of the programs here at ETS and that is already actually providing score reports. Uh the director of that uh program, uh was","not being trust our group actually. Uh she wasn't, she doesn't, I felt like she wants the project but somehow she felt like we are not capable of doing the project. And","we, once we understand that and once I realized this is what's going on and she is kind of not being negative in the meetings um I tried to reach out to her by phone and","e-mail and one time I spent, I got five minutes of time with her and I sat down with her and I said. This is not something that is for us actually, this is something","that we are building for them and it says once we built for them how much of the, the programs importance and how good it is for the program I tried to picture that to","her and soon we started developing and I uh used to give her demos of the project progress. And I remember she saying after our first demo uh [it has] how the score","reports uh gets reported and uh how everything now can be automated and how users can be happy and I asked her to share the screens with the users. And, once she did","that and how the users responses, she actually was honest to me and said I can't be thankful enough to your manager, for providing me such a solution and so for, uh but","she didn't apologize or anything. That's fine she said, she understood how important this project uh could be for her and how much it will be lift of their groups pride","in uh ETS. So, uh it was hard in the beginning but it kind of worked out I think this way, in this situation my director also helped me how to approach this person uh",10,5.5,"6"
"10_segment-05","Well um there are a lot of times in the workplace, in the work projects that we are working on that we have to um compromise um a lot of situations at work, the releases and","what needs to be done, what needs not to be done or what we'll be able to by but the deadline or what we will not be able to do by the deadline, that's how it is um in","negotiation and um working with um different groups to make sure that things would come out what we wished for. But that, that won't be the case all the times, sometimes we","are successful and sometimes we are not. um Well recently we were supposed to do a full release for one of the projects but um given the time line and everything we had to","make sure which one takes the priority one or the important ones that we can do. And um we reached out to the group that we are working for and we laid out the plan to them.","Okay, we had um put them as three different buckets which is the most appropriate and most important one that needs to go out within the time frame and which can wait for a","bit longer or try to squeeze in within this one or some of the things that we can push out till the next release. um It wasn't easy with the group but um they understand the","situation too so they try to push in some more things within the same release I know that would make our team work more hours um more time to spend on the project. But uh um","we are in a uh programming side, IT side, so in this situation [usually pro], we had to listen to our users. [We need to take their], um we had most of the time we needed, we","end up doing what they requested for us. um So that's what we do, um we try to do which they have come up with um within the situation and provided by for this release and",10,5.9,"6"
"10_segment-06","Uh Earlier the situation, [this kind of], I didn't come across many of them but uh recently we were uh moving between two different technologies that we need to","use in our upcoming project. Uh I tried it since we are actually with the current project we are working on we took a new technology initiative. And within that","project we have another sub project and uh I kind of, I said that we need to take the sub project also needs to be in the new technology and stop [being], going","back to the old one. Because anyway we are in a new why not take everything in new in this uh project. Uh One of my teammate he's uh like no why can't we just","use the old technology so that we don't have to uh hit too many huddles with the existing one and the upcoming one. I was like, well we are in the cold water","already let's go deeper and uh  let's deal with it right now and stuff later. So uh so we decided to go with and they agreed, now my manager said I think that's,","that's the way we should do it and right now we are already in deep water so let's just go with the new technology and if any huddles come uh we'll deal with it.","So uh that's why uh we decided to go with the new technology. I think I don't do much persuasion or I don't be very pushy in our projects like uh when it comes","uh and they ask for my uh opinions, I do lay it out but I really don't push it hard. Uh I let listen everybody and what they have to say and make the decision.","So in this situation uh the rest of the group also kind of agreed to go with the new technology and uh we decided to go with the new service technology for this",10,4.5,"4"
"10_segment-07","Well in many situations every time you work in a project of the group you don't have to, it's not necessary that you had to like every person that comes in the group and it's the","same thing they don't have to like me or but I try my best you know to do work together with other person in the project. So because ultimately it's the project's success, uh our","failure depends on us, so yes it does make sense to get along with the person that we work with. Uh so I do have a couple situations that I had been like this, uh recently we","started work. We always work with this group there we have very good relationship with this group and uh they always accomplish, uh provide what we need. And we always say, well","they provide assistance for our projects so. But in this group we had a new person, they had a new person and that person was assigned to one of the projects that I'm working with.","It's not the person is bad, it's just the person has a different uh personality. She would be more visible in the e-mails and everything but when it comes to the work it's, it's not","uh productive. That's how, that's why we feel like it. Uh there was a big tension going on and it was continuing that way, so uh I suggested that she wants to go out for lunch or","anything she agreed. At the same time I was nervous to go out to lunch myself with her so I invited another friend and we had some friendly conversation at lunch and uh I understand","things were very good but it's okay I tried to keep everything in the e-mail and uh tried to specific relating to work you know this is what we need and uh whether she can focus on","this and provide this for us. Uh it's working, it's going on uh I won't say the way I want to work with her in future projects, I would say no but at least we are in this now so we",10,5.2,"5"
"10_segment-08","Well, my job is not anything of physical demand, physically demanding it's just uh spending more time on a task mostly uh it's the one","thing. One thing I do not like is attending these boring meetings, uh some of the meetings can be just sit there and go around on the same","issue go around and around and around it's like never ending they just don't want to break it. They want to reach to a point that","everybody agrees upon. Whether do I  feel like uh that I'm doing more than the other teammates? I don't know I mean well uh we have two","other leads and we are three leads in our group right now. Uh I do when we all have our own different projects but uh I feel like I do go","some of the meetings more often than they had to because uh it depends on the work situation or the project that we are working on that's","how it's going. Uh But uh tedious [I don't think my], I can't, I can say sometimes it can get tedious but I don't mind if it's the","tedious, relating to coding I won't mind doing it at all. But uh if it is tedious that I need to make sure other people are working and I","try to do my you know try to do it, help them out to get the things, help them out to get to reach a point that they can do it themselves","but I, nicely say I cannot do this, help them out all the time. That way but uh I think it's going okay for now. I wouldn't say it's too",10,4.3,"4"
"10_segment-09","Well I wish they do that. They give leadership of a project to","one of the person and they just make me work for the project. I","wish they do that because um it's been, it's been a lot of work","recently so, not just recently it's been past two, three years","and like that. um And this year is the craziest year so I","wouldn't mind to work under a person's leadership at this time.","So uh I'm okay with it and to me honestly why not? If the","person is leading a project and we are all in the same project,","uh we should work it in a way to make the project be a success,","that's how, that's the way that I see it. So um yeah, I won't",10,2.5,"2"
"10_segment-10","um I attend a lot of conference calls and","sometimes they are very boring and I don't pay","much attention sometimes and I might miss a key","point and unless they call out my project name","or my name I ask them to repeat the question and","provide the response that I can. um I do not","have a situation where I missed a really","important key point while in a meeting and uh","that affected the project. I'm not in that","situation so far, hopefully I would not get in",10,2.9,"3"
"10_segment-11","Uh Difficult information or critical feedback. Well the difficult information that I had to deal with uh would be a application","crushing production, or the application that don't crush and that kind of information. Uh [Usually] critical feedback is if I","felt if the users are being, give us a negative feedback or and they do e-mails that kind of things always. So uh actually I feel","so bad to take it it's just my manager is the one that says it's okay it's part of the job. Uh The situation is when we had the,","uh one of the score reporting sites went up. Uh The scores that were given in there uh were taking much longer to download and","users are really really upset about it. So uh he told us how, we talked how else we can make it uh faster but uh taking that as a","programmer taking that to my uh manager was not easy for me because you don't want to say you messed up in a code anyway. So Or","your programmers messed up but I really don't want to blame it on our programmers so as a lead I failed uh and I would have been","you know, more visual uh or more vigilant of what the programmers are doing in the coding. So that's what happened. Uh We","corrected it, we had to do it another release but uh that wasn't easy and I tried my best not to do it again. And I'm trying it's",10,4.3,"4"
"10_segment-12","Actually I think I'm getting better at it, um in this kind of","situations I used to be explaining to our users in technical coding","terms and not understanding their blank faces. But soon I learned that","uh that's not the way I should, I shouldn't explain to them just like","how I explained to the other person. So um when it comes to if there is","an issue or how we need to implement a solution, it's better, I","realized it's better to explain it to them in a real life scenario, uh","than explaining on to them how complex it is in the on technology side.","So uh I don't recall right now there is some specific examples but","that's the way I realized I should be doing and that's the way, that's",10,4.2,"4"
"13_segment-01","Okay, uh so at uh work here uh I was part of a project where we had to do uh","cognitive lab study. And uh while I wasn't the formal leader, uh because I was a","principal investigator. I uh tried to uh assume a leadership role in that project","because I uh kind of was part in charge of scheduling participants and recruiting","participants and then running the actual cog lab studies. uh Specifically","interviewing the participants and then organizing the data afterwards. Uh The","outcome of that was that uh we are able to successfully uh run all the","participants and we met our goals and we are able to present some of that data at","uh a technical advisory meeting uh a couple of months later. Uh So I thought that","it went very well and I felt that I had some autonomy with it and I was able to",13,5.1,"5"
"13_segment-02","Uh so To build motivation in my coworkers. Uh The background of the situation is uh when I first started working here I","had heard that uh a lot of people would like to have training opportunities outside of their regular roles. Uh","Specifically for different software packages. Uh I would really enjoy learning more about different software packages Uh","for statistical analysis specifically. So I took the initiative uh a couple of months after I started to uh find out who","had some expertise in different areas and different programs. And then I approach them and ask them if they would like to","do kind of like a brown bag lecture uh and give us a little bit of training for the research assistants. Uh I was able to","uh schedule a couple of different uh appointments with that and I motivated my coworkers to want to go because I knew that","uh they all shared an interest in learning more about these topics. Uh And I found a convenient time for all of us to","meet. And basically just by setting it up and taking that initiative, that was motivation enough for them to want to come","to the meetings and participate. And we had a very good turnout for both the meetings so far and we're going to schedule",13,5.7,"6"
"13_segment-03","So A time where I was a member of a group where two of the members didn't work well together. Uh When I was in undergrad I was a resident","advisor. Uh And as part of my job requirements we had to uh put on a couple of different events per semester and work on teams with the","other RA's uh in our section. And uh working on a couple of them some people weren't particularly fond of each other. uh but I think I","helped handle the situation by uh realizing that there were some disagreements between people. Uh And if I were in charge of the group uh","I would ask them to perform different tasks uh to accomplish the specific goal we had for that uh project. Uh So I might ask somebody to","make the advertisements and ask the other person to uh  work with the catering or something. So that they're not working completely uh","together but they're still working on a team with a common goal. Uh In another situation uh where two people aren't working well together","uh I guess you can consider the floor that uh I was the RS on a team. and some of the residents uh weren't too fond of each other so uh we","kind of had a mediation between them and handled that situation through uh having them both sit down and talk about their own particular","perspectives and point of view about the situation. And their wants and needs in the situation and then coming to a mutual agreement and",13,5.8,"6"
"13_segment-04","uh A time when I had to try and gain the trust of others I was working with um while trying to negotiate with them. um I guess a","particular time would be um when, um  I guess when I was an undergrad and I was an RA again like the situation before. um And just","dealing with some residents, um I mainly had uh freshmen residents on my floor so they were all new to the school and obviously new to","me. um So I could gain their trust and they had to gain my trust. um And I had to negotiate with then often because for example they","might be too loud uh late at night and then I'd have to go and tell them to be quiet. um But sometimes for certain situations we'd have","to negotiate with them. For example if it was somebody's birthday and the whole floor wanted to get together and build the community and","sing happy birthday to them but it was midnight. um We kind of had to be okay with that and say it's for a good cause, um you can kind","of be loud after hours. um But in that sense um I think that's a good example of where um we didn't know each other and had to kind of","build a relationship. um Especially one where I was um the superior and they were kind of the subordinate in the relationship. um And","there were multiple times where we had to negotiate, but I think because we had a good relationship um we were able to negotiate  a",13,4.3,"4"
"13_segment-05","OK so For the uh question, uh working here uh I've had to divide up certain tasks uh for some of my projects","that I'm working on with uh the other research assistant that I do a lot of work with. Uh so we usually get a","large assignment and then have to divide it up uh knowing that both of us have other projects that we're","currently working on simultaneously. Uh So sometimes uh we'll be able to evenly divide up the task between","the two of us uh to spend the same amount of time uh doing the same amount of work. Well other times we have","to kind of bargain and negotiate and compromise uh that this week I'm might do a little bit more work uh or","she might do a little bit more work. But then the subsequent times uh that we have a similar assignment or","another assignment in general, we know that the other person will have to pick up their weight at that point.","Uh So in that sense uh we bargain and compromise but we always reach mutually exclusive, mutually favorable","outcome uh through communication. And we both know that uh we'll live up to the expectations the second time",13,6.1,"6"
"13_segment-06","For this question um I have sort of a more simple um answer for basically uh both my direct coworker, uh another research assistant","who's working on the same project I'm working on as well as my project manager for that same project. um We all kind of in the","beginning when I started working here um just systematically throughout the week we'd email each other, updates or um go to each","other's cubicle or speak to each other directly about what we're working on. But there wasn't really time where we'd all sit down um","just as the three of us as a small group and discus what was going to happen um for the rest of the week, um or at the end of the week","what we accomplish. So I approach both of them and suggested that we meet uh once at the beginning of the week, Monday morning um and","once kind of towards the end of the week on Thursday. Because I thought that if we met at the beginning of the week we could discus um","some other tasks and uh goals we wanted to accomplish as a group uh during that week. And then also in the meeting at the end of the","week we could kind of reflect on what we were able to accomplish in that week. And if we met the goals that we had set on uh Monday of","that week. um So I just presented it to them basically as are presenting that now. And they thought it was a great idea and we've been",13,5.1,"5"
"13_segment-07","So first question, uh when I was in my undergrad program, uh I had a psychology class I was taking. And we had to do a group project um and I was part of a","group of um two other um guys. One was my really good friend and then another person was just another um student in the class. And my friend and I were","always meeting um and discussing what we wanted to do with the project and doing the research and dividing up the workload and the third person um really","could never make the meetings, he was too busy. um And then we never really saw his contribution to the project um and even a couple of days before it was","due um we still hadn't seen anything even though my friend and I had finished our parts. And the day of the project we received an email in the morning from","the other person saying that he was sick and couldn't come in. So um my friend and I went to our professor and let him know the situation. And uh basically","that the other person hadn't really done anything. So uh our professor gave us the option to just present, um just the two of us, myself and my friend and","uh we went with that option and we just kind of adlibed the other persons part.um And ended up doing well on the project um but that was a situation where","the other person that I was working with I didn't particularly like because I didn't feel like he was um pulling his weight. um But in the end I think we","had a favorable outcome because we were able to approach um the professor and let him know the situation. And we worked through it and um were able to adopt",13,4,"4"
"13_segment-08","Uh for this question I don't necessarily have a specific example uh but there have been times where uh in one project I'm","working on currently uh the workload has increased uh severely um in a short amount of time. And usually I'm able to divide","up the work between myself and the other RA on the project but sometimes uh there's been instances where I'll have to take","a little bit more of that load. If she has another thing that she's currently working on that has a tight deadline. Uh so","in those situations uh I tend to just stay a little bit later at work uh and try to get that done. But uh I often","communicate with my product manager uh about the workload uh just to let him know what we're working on and how it's going","and uh how the time frame is looking for and I also communicate with the uh principal investigator on the project uh to","give him updates uh at different time points to just let him know where I'm at with the project. Uh so when given more than","uh normal I just try to manage it as best I can and create a time line for myself and accomplish the tasks even though it's","a little bit more than normal. Um all the while communicating with the uh different people on my team that need to know uh",13,5.9,"6"
"13_segment-09","For this question I can recall um a particular situation where this has happened to me um but if it were to","happen to me um basically where somebody came into an existing project and took a little leadership um but did","not listen to um some of the contributions that people were putting forward. um I think I would handle a","situation by um approaching a person that took over the leadership and um asking what their vision of the","project is. um And expressing the fact that um we uh were going in a certain direction and I just want to make","sure that um I understand what the new um idea or goal is at that point um so that I can help with that. um","But I would also put forth some of my um ideas in the meeting one on one with that person and just let them","know that um these are some things that I've been considering and um that I would like them to also consider","it and if we can figure out a way that that can work to the overall goal of the project um that would be","great. um But like i said i don't believe I've been in this situation before, but if i were i think that's how",13,5.5,"6"
"13_segment-10","For this question um a time that I had to use my listening skills to overcome a communications","problem um has occurred just a few times. uh Mainly as a result of initially communicating over","email. um So the project manager or the principal investigator um may have emailed myself or the","team and said they would like uh certain tasks accomplished. um But over email it wasn't too","specific um as to what they meant. um So I had to use my listening skills when I decided to take","the action to call that person over the phone, um just to walk through a little bit more detail","about what they were looking for um in terms of the task they wanted us to accomplish. um So in","that way I would have to um speak with them, ask them a few more questions and then I would always","take notes um and repeat back to them what I heard them say as uh the steps we needed to take. Just","to make sure that we were on the same and um there is complete uh transparency with uh what they",13,6.4,"6"
"13_segment-11","So for this uh question, uh a difficult uh time where I had to communicate information or","feedback to my supervisor. Uh I guess I would say there has been, uh there was a time where I","was working with some data and had run a number of analysis on it and uh kind of reported my","findings to my supervisor. And then upon uh going back in to do some more analysis I realize","that there is an error in the data uh that needed to be fixed. And it was uh I guess a little","bit difficult because I didn't want to go back and say that I'm going to have to redo those","analysis because there is some error in the data. Uh But I knew that I needed to sat that uh","because the calculations were of. So I let my supervisor know uh and try to as quickly and","efficiently as possible rerun the analysis and then report uh the new findings to my supervisor.","And everything worked out better than I thought uh and I think that all of the parties involved",13,5.7,"6"
"13_segment-12","For this question the background of the situation is that uh some of","the projects that I'm working on uh deal with some more uh technical","psychological uh information. And if I wanted to go tell uh some","family or friends that uh aren't particularly knowledgeable in that","field. I would often just tell them uh very broadly what I was doing","and uh to get any more specific I would just try to give uh an","example that applied to their every day life or something that I","thought uh they could readily understand and compare to. So uh I","would just take more technical jargon and apply it to kind of like","an everyday situation uh so that it would make a little bit more",13,5.2,"5"
"17_segment-01","Telling you about a situation that I was not the formal leader but tried to assume a leadership role. My formal","position was actually a director, so most of the roles that I assumed were of a leadership role. um One situation","that's come to mind is probably a situation that led up to becoming a director, uh taking a director type um role","without being the director and that would be closing down an office. Our company had acquired a company uh from","Washington DC, uh it had gone on for a number of years for various reasons uh the company needed to be, the physical","location needed to be closed. uh We didn't have necessarily the department or a person to handle that and bottom line I","went to the director of operations and volunteered to uh shut down the office. uh I think he was overjoyed that I did","it, uh that I offered this and uh went down giving daily updates uh right up about what I should and should not do in","closing down a physical office was done during a snow storm so it was a nightmare getting down there. [It was a night]","I remember driving through a foot of snow uh to the office everyday from my hotel room but uh it worked out fantastic",17,5.8,"6"

To do that, um I","have prepared a proposal which I presented to the uh Medicaid department in the health in New jersey, uh New Jersey health","department.

"18_segment-08","uh The only thing that I can think that comes closely to answer this question is when I was working for an International company.

"18_segment-10","Something that would come close to that would be actually","through a job interview that I had um was a position um to","become a liaison between the IT department and the business","side.

Often times a lot of","these people were not computer savvy and changing to a new software or upgraded software was","a challenge for them. uh Being that I was a technical support, I had an office in the","client's office and they usually reached me by phone.

Something that I would understand, something","that I can relate to with my experience of my years as an Admissions Officer or uh in some other aspect of my life. So that if its common enough, most of the audience of course will","understand it. Uh I find doing that takes the frustration and confusion out of the concept uh and helps to make sure that we are not speaking uh ETS language or uh Psychometrician","language. Uh As a matter of fact I even had to explain the word 'Psychometrician' uh at one university when I was presenting to the graduate faculty uh because they did not understand","what that was. Very easily I could have chosen another set of words which I did from that presentation onwards but it just never occurred to me that they wouldn't know that. Uh So","sometimes you won't know uh that you are approaching a task or a technical uh complicated phrase uh in somebody's background until they tell you. But the ability to always break it",24,5.5,"6"
"31_segment-01","A few years ago I was working in a retail situation and the human resource director on the property um","really kind of just morphed into that role, didn't have a human resource background and didn't really have","any formal training in human resources or training. um She was getting very backed up in trying to reach the","corporate goals for training for the staff at the store and although that wasn't my position um and I was in","no way a formal leader in regard to that. I kind of took the lead in helping her to understand how to","motivate the staff to pursue the training that they needed. Not only for their benefit but for the benefit","of the whole company. um I've also mentored and coached her on different techniques she could use in","reaching the employees, in getting them excited and motivated to complete the training. um It was very","fulfilling to me to be able to help her and to try to do it in such a way as to not step on her toes or","impose on her position. um But just to not only help the company help the staff but help her to be better in",31,6.4,"6"
"31_segment-02","When I was working at the New Jersey Division of Taxation there was a major culture shift going on um in regard to computer usage. We had a lot of older employees who didn't","really have a lot of computer experience, the organization was moving in the direction where auditors and investigators were expected to prepare correspondence for themselves","using word processors, uh create spreadsheets and generally use the Microsoft suite of products. Um they were budget constraints at the time so the concept of sending all the","staff out for training wasn't reasonable so they decided to open an in house training center uh which was called the Reach Center. And the Reach Center was designed to train","these employees on how to use a Windows based computer. Um there was a lot of push back from some of the older workers who really didn't feel like they were at a point in","their life where they wanted to learn something new.    The uh coworkers that I had, that I was working with on the project, some of them, were a little uncomfortable with","trying to push people, what they felt was push people into the direction of computers. Um but I was able to create a very fun enjoyable atmosphere where not only my coworkers","but my subordinates and that the trainees all felt validated, they felt important, they felt like they were learning things. Um and the outcome was that we ended up creating a","wonderful computer training lab where the courses that we offered became so sought after that people from other departments and divisions were requesting to come into the","Division of Taxation and have training done there. Um so it was really, it was a wonderful experience for everybody involved and a lot of the old timers really fell in love",31,6,"6"
"31_segment-03","It is a very difficult situation whenever your leading a group or working with a group where not everybody can get along. Uh We did have some instances in the Reach","Center where some of the employees didn't exactly care for each other on a personal level. The way that I handled that situation was first and foremost I did a lot of","team building activities and a lot of coaching and mentoring and trying to encourage each other to look for the best in their coworkers. And look at each other strengths","and try to downplay their weaknesses and especially take note of the areas where you have a strength where somebody else doesn't and perhaps you can back them up or help","them in that area and help them grow that strength too. Um As much as possible where it was reasonable and detrimental to the program I allowed those individuals to work","on separate parts of the program independently. So there wasn't so much uh constant contact between them until they got to the point where they could begin to respect","each other strengths and each others contributions to the situation. It's not always easy to handle that and it's not always easy to get past it, sometimes you have to","remove somebody from the group, sometimes it helps to add a third person to the group to kind of mitigate some of that tension between the first two. So in my case I was","able to just really keep pushing the team building aspect until we got to the point after a few uh months of having a really strong team. And it goes through that whole","uh you know forming storming, norming, performing situation you have with any team and once they got past that storming stage they were able to normalize and really",31,5.7,"6"
"31_segment-04","Um Any time you start to work in a new area with a new company on a new project you always have to go through a period of trying to establish your","trustworthiness and gaining trust with the people that you're going to work with. Uh That can be particularly difficult if you come into a project or something","where there's a sense or urgency and things have to move quickly. I was the project manager at a marketing firm for an interactive silo of the company and there","was, there were some people in the traditional silo who were really reluctant to engage and buy into the whole idea of interactive marketing. So it was a very","uh urgent need to gain their trust quickly and to have them understand the importance of the direction that we were moving in with the company as a whole. And","the way that I did that, the way that I was able to gain their trust was one by genuinely caring uh about them as people, about their projects, about looking","for ways to incorporate and not eliminate the things that they had done traditionally. Um And by removing that idea from them that somehow the interactive","direction of the company was going to eliminate the need for the more traditional pieces. We were able to gain their trust and start to have them see where the","Internet is really just the hub of activity and all the other traditional pieces still come into play. And now with the use of the Internet we can track the","success of those other tactics. Uh And the outcome was that the company really started to explode in the interactive space and start to get some real traction",31,5.8,"6"
"31_segment-05","So one time I was working on this really large website redesigne um for a company. And the stakeholders at the company we were doing the work for were very slow in returning","responses and to getting us the information that we needed to complete the project. As a result our um deadline was not going to be made for the launch of the project. And","originally the customer or the client just wanted me to have my staff work basically around the clock to try to still deliver on the original date regardless of the fact","that they missed every deadline that they had. um In that situation yes clearly the client was wrong, yes clearly it was the clients fault that the project wasn't going to","launch successfully in a timely fashion but it's never good business to disappoint a client. So what I was able to do was to negotiate and to work with the client and pick","the most important parts of the launch. Do a soft launch on the date that we were supposed to originally launch and then follow that up with a full launch about two weeks","later. um So the client was extremely happy, the features and the changes to the web redesign were included that the features and the changes that were most important to the","client were included in the soft launch. And some of the other features and some of the other enhancements which weren't as important to the client were held of and put out","with the full launch, um like I said about two weeks later. So ultimately you ended up with everybody being very happy, the employees were happy that they didn't have to","sacrifice their lives for the next um couple of weeks and trying to meet an unreasonable deadline. And the client was happy because they got what they really wanted in a",31,6.6,"7"
"31_segment-06","While I was working in the field of marketing um a great portion of my responsibility was just that uh persuading people, persuading clients to accept the","proposals that wee had put together for them.  um The client that I just spoke of with the really big website redesign and feature enhancement was one of those","such cases. They had had a pretty stagnant web design, for a years they felt that it was doing the job for them. um However based on statistical information,","based on user trends, based on trends in the fashion industry on-line, we were able to successfully convince the client that they really were missing out on a","great deal of their market share because they weren't really marketing to their true clients anymore. um They were marketing to the clients and the customers","that they thought they had as opposed to really marketing to the customers that they had. And um it's not uncommon for businesses to get into that situation","where whom they think is their customer is not really accurately who is their customer. um So and the only way that you can convince people differently of that","is to show them cold hard facts, to show them statistical data, to show them numbers, to show them um ROI figures and things that are going to have value to","them. And we were able to successfully turn this client's website into a hub of information and interactive feature for their true customers. The customers who","were seeking them out and looking for them on a regular basis. In the end the customer, uh the client was extremely happy with the outcome and had won some",31,5.9,"6"
"31_segment-07","um Quite a few years ago I worked with a woman who actually was my supervisor at the time and she really was not a people person. She had a very difficult","time communicating, she was the type of person that you would be working at your desk and if she had something to say to you, rather than come over and","say it she would write it on like a Post-it note and stick it on your computer screen in front of your face where you were sitting there. um And at first","I was very uncomfortable with the situation and I struggled with it a little bit in the beginning. But then what I did is I kind of refocused myself on","two things one is I was there to do a job and so I put all my focus on my work and getting my job done. And the other thing was I came to the realization","that if you get to know anybody well enough you can understand why they are the way they are. And that doesn't necessarily excuse behavior or change","behavior or make behavior ah more acceptable, but it does take any personal sting away from their behavior. And so little by little more and more I got to","know this woman and got to know of her own personal struggles. I was able to separate um anything I was feeling personally about her behavior and just","understand that she's just a product of her own environment and that there were external things and internal things going on within her that caused this","behavior. um I ended up working with her for years fine and we just never became best of friends but we were able to successfully get the work done that",31,5.5,"6"
"31_segment-08","um I have to say this is kind of a tough question for me to answer because I don't think that I've ever really been in a situation","where I felt that I was being given more than my share of unpleasant tasks. And so perhaps that's just evidence that I never had that","bad of a manager um or I'm just fortunate. What I can say is how I think I would handle it if that situation came up. um If I was","ever in a situation where I thought that I felt like I was being kind of dumped on with the garbage work. uh I would hope that my","first response would be to go talk with to my manager or supervisor and ask them their thoughts on it. And why, you know they felt it","was appropriate that I was getting all this work and that it wasn't being shared among the employees. um Because quite frankly","without knowing the facts there might be a reason why the manager is giving you more of that to do than somebody else. So um I can't","say for sure because I've never been in that situation but I do hope that I would at least have enough respect for my manager or","supervisor to go discus it with them first. And then if there wasn't really a valid or a substantial reason for them giving me all","that work. um Hopefully maybe I'd be able to work it out with them or negotiate with them to try and find a more equitable way to",31,4.9,"5"
"31_segment-09","So I've only been in a situation once in my life where I was the part of a group project and the leader of the project was totally marching to the","beat of his own drum and cared little for what anybody else had to contribute. um And basically had the end figured out before the project even","started. At, in this situation it was a community group I was working with, it was a community where I'm not a resident of that community but we","had business connections in the community and that's why I was asked to serve on this committee. um Unfortunately for me personally this","particular committee was so, um was being so manipulated politically by the powers that be within the local government. And like I mentioned it","was clear that there was no real intention of ever um getting consensus for anything, there was no real intention of ever considering anybody","else's ideas or um suggestions. That because it was, because the committee was not my local committee, because I was volunteering on it, because I","was giving up a lot of my time and seeing no true genuine um working together. I just decided to step down from the committee in that particular","case. And you know the committee does still exist and they are still moving forward with their predesignated plans. um But it has gotten more and","more narrowly focused on members of the political group that was, that were behind the forming of the committee to start with.

"31_segment-10","Good old listening skills. um On of my favorite lines to people is God gave you two ears and one mouth for a reason, use them","proportionately. So uh listening skills are extremely important in life in general but especially at work. And I did have a situation a","few years ago where somebody had sent an email and basically it was a very angry email and really defined everything that person was not","going to do in conjunction with a project that we had going on. um So rather than take it at face value and rather than just accept that","this person sent this email I went over and sat down and had a meeting with them. And got into a conversation with them about why they","felt the way they did about the tasks and the items that they were supposed to be working on this project. And after spending some time","with the person and listening it turned out that it was all a matter of miscommunication. um The young lady involved was given the wrong","due dates for projects, due dates that were unrealistic [and were], um she didn't want to set herself up for failure and I understand","that. So once we were able to sit down and I heard where her concerns were and I went back and got the accurate information and share","that with her um we were able to overcome this problem and she was more than happy to work on the project. And she actually did a",31,5.7,"6"
"31_segment-11","So one of the toughest situations I've ever been in was a few years ago when I was working in a pretty good size office and uh some rumors and suspicions started","about romantic involvement between the chief of my department and my direct supervisor. Uh I don't know whether or not they were true, it's not my problem, not","my business, however the rumors were really causing  a lot of difficulty in the office, uh they were causing a lot of difficulty for our department as a whole.","It was causing a lot of difficulty to the little divisions or sections within our department because this gentleman was a department head, this woman was a","division head. Uh And the other division heads were feeling uh resentful and like they were not getting the priority and the treatment that they deserved. Uh It","was like the constant subject of conversation in the workplace and quite frankly I [went into], had a meeting with not only my supervisor but with the chief of","the department and just told them both This is what is being said, this is the effect that it's having on the department. And you know at first the chief was","very angry, uh really felt that it was none of anybody's business. Uh However I was able to convey to him the fact that true or not, you know uh if people","thought it was true and it was impacting their work-life, that he had an obligation to rectify the situation however he saw fit.

"31_segment-12","Since I am a classroom instructor and trainer I've spent a lot of time in my life explaining complex and technical ideas to non technical people. um Especially","like I said back when we started the computer center and so many of our auditors and investigators really had no computer experience whatsoever. um Two things that","I find the most beneficial when I'm doing this is one to take every um complex idea or technical task and break it done into small um digestible chunks. And the","other thing I do is I work a lot with analogies, because when you can create a parallel in somebody's mind between what they're doing, um why they're doing it and","something they're familiar with doing. It helps to bridge that gap and cut that learning curve um substantially. Back when I was teaching people computers early on","when they really didn't know much about computers I was able to use a lot of analogies about um file storage rooms and file cabinets and filing draws and folders","within those draws. And using those um material things that they were used to working with on a regular basis I was able to um help them to transfer that knowledge","to the file tree in their computer system. And help them to really get an idea of understanding how things are stored on their hard drive. And how they have the","flexibility to add another file room, add another file cabinet, just add a drawer into an existing file cabinet, just add some folders into a drawer that's already","working well for them. um So for me it's never been difficult to do this, it's something that just comes naturally to me, it's all about small pieces and",31,6.6,"7"
